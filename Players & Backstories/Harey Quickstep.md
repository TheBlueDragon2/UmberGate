### Full Backstory
**The Rogue Harengon's Tale**  

In the shimmering glades of the Feywild, where dances flicker like fireflies and the whims of the fey hold sway, the ethereal Harengon Harey Quickstep was born into the *Whispering Warrens*—a subtle warren hidden in the shadows beneath the chaotic gaze of the Seelie Court. Harey's playful cunning shone early, scouting Unseelie threats from treetops and ancient oaks, pilfering secrets with nimble paws.

An enchanted trinket promised luck and fortune, whispering of greater destinies. But trouble brewed when Harey uncovered her clan's dark secret: the *Murkroot Bag*, a foul bargain with the hag **Thistledown** for eternal youth. The clan harvested cursed roots to fuel the hag's potions, trading their future for fleeting vigor.

Dagger couched like judgment, Harey sought to expose Thistledown and shatter the hag's peace. Captured and branded a traitor, she escaped through the twisting paths of the Feywild, emerging dust-caked into the material world. Whispers led her to Umbergate—the edge where fey magic bleeds wildest into the Fracture. The hag's trail may end here... or just begin.

### Allies & Contacts
- **Whispering Warrens clan** – complicated; some loyal kin may send messages via fey portals
- Enchanted trinket – minor luck charm (DM: rolls advantage 1/short rest?)

### Enemies
- [[NPCs/Background/Thistledown]] – night hag dealmaker, likely pursuing Harey

### Goals
- **Short-term:** Track Thistledown's scent in Umbergate (rumors at Caravan Market?)
- **Medium-term:** Destroy the Murkroot Bag or expose the clan's corruption
- **Long-term:** Free her warren from the hag's curse, using Wilds magic

### Secrets
**Harey knows:** The clan's "eternal youth" comes at the cost of feeding Unseelie pacts—children vanish into the bag.

**DM only:** Thistledown has a hidden lair in the Wilds edge, trading with Dr. Nyx for aethersteel "upgrades." The trinket resonates near the Maw, drawing Vane's giggling attention.
