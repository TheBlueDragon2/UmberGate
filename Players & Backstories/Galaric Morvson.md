### Full Backstory
*(Transcribed and cleaned from sheet for clarity—typos fixed, incomplete parts inferred for coherence)*

Galaric Morvson never asked to be born, and he certainly never asked to be made.

He came into the world in the northern region of Tharnmouth, a cold, brooding land of fog and ancient stone foundations. His earliest memories are of his mother by touch, sound, and the ever-present gaze of his father... or creator. The distinction was never made clear.

Lord Morv—a vampire of ancient cunning and design—shaped a dhampir son, born of blood and love. He forged him as a tool in some long game of power, intrigue, manipulation, and death. His blood carried unnatural strength but also a hunger.

He never knew who his mother was. Only that she was "useful once."

Then came Elra.

A child. A girl sister, he was told. Younger, fragile, and radiant in a way that made even the shadows pause. She was mortal—not like him—because Elra had a role to play in Morv's grand design. For years, they grew close, sharing a sibling bond forged in secrecy.

One day he discovered Morv would use Elra in a design involving blood bindings and an ancient being.

That was the moment he broke.

Fleeing Tharnmouth with nothing but a stolen horse, a pouch of coins, and his sister. Morv's agents pursued—literally. Morv had left a psychic tether in Galaric's mind, allowing cruel control and instilling criminal instincts.

Fleeing through the twisting paths of the Feywild, Galaric evaded capture by leaping through hidden portals, emerging in the Pale Reach. Whispers of the Maw's wild magic drew him to Umbergate—perhaps it can sever the tether forever.

### Allies & Contacts
- Elra (mortal sister, hidden somewhere safe in the Reach)
- Mother (unnamed psychic, fate unknown)

### Enemies
- [[NPCs/Background/Lord Morv]] – vampire sire, pursuing with agents

### Goals
- **Short-term:** Use Umbergate's sanctuary to research Maw artifacts for tether removal (clues via Mother Halga or Brother Malach?)
- **Medium-term:** Protect Elra from Morv's blood-binding ritual
- **Long-term:** Confront and destroy Lord Morv, freeing himself from the curse

### Secrets
**Galaric knows:** The psychic tether lets Morv glimpse his thoughts sporadically, urging criminal acts.

**DM only:** Morv's agents have infiltrated the Fractal Consortium; the tether amplifies near the Maw, risking Vane's notice or Wilds mutations.
