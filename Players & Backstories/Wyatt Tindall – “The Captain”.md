**Class & Level:** Swashbuckler Rogue 3  
**Player:** (your name here)  
**Status:** Active – arrived in Umbergate 3 days ago

### Appearance & Manner
Charismatic seafarer in his early 30s. Weather-tanned skin, easy grin that doesn’t quite reach wary eyes anymore. Wears a salt-stained navy coat with gold braid, rapier at the hip, and a brightly colored fey parrot (Sparrow) usually perched on his shoulder. Left forearm bears a mysterious, faintly glowing tattoo-symbol that sometimes fades when his “companion” manifests.

### Personality Traits
- “I face problems with a smile and a plan.”
- “Betrayal is the one sin I never forgive.”

### Ideal
Freedom. The sea is wide and the world is full of wonders; no one should be chained by fear or tyranny.

### Bond
The Dreadful Shadow was my home and my family. I will take her back or burn her to the waterline before I let pirates fly her colors.

### Flaw
Trust comes hard since the mutiny; I assume everyone has a price.

### Full Backstory
*(Everything the player wrote, lightly formatted for readability)*

Wyatt Tindall grew up with loving, supportive parents who encouraged every dream. Bardic college, fencing lessons, athletic competitions — whatever caught his fancy, they made it happen. In his late teens he fell in love with the sea and enlisted in the navy, quickly becoming the life of any crew with his stories, swordplay, and boundless bravado.

A disastrous pirate ambush left Wyatt the sole survivor of his ship, adrift for days until he washed up on a deserted island ruled by the enigmatic **Morrigan**. She offered escape in exchange for silence and gave him two gifts: a vial of pale-blue liquid and a sealed letter. Drinking the potion unlocked latent magic — spectral hand, a summoning incantation, and the appearance of **Sparrow**, his fey parrot familiar.

With his parents’ help he bought the swift brigantine *Dreadful Shadow* and became “The Captain,” a legendary mercenary protector of merchant shipping. For a decade the ship and its rotating crews were the terror of pirates and the guardian angel of honest traders.

Everything changed when his latest first mate, **Iron Jack**, orchestrated a mutiny. Sparrow overheard the plot; Wyatt confronted the crew and barely escaped with his life. Rowing away in a stolen jolly boat, he was once again rescued by Morrigan, who this time gifted him the living tattoo on his left forearm — a daily summonable companion that takes her likeness (or other forms).

For three years Wyatt hunted the six mutineers. Five are dead or imprisoned. The sixth — **Iron Jack** — was spotted entering Umbergate five days ago, taking advantage of the 30-day sanctuary law. Wyatt arrived three days later. The clock is ticking.

### Allies & Contacts
- [[Players & Backstories/Morrigan]] – unpredictable fey benefactor
- Sparrow – fey parrot familiar (Find Familiar + flavor)
- Tattoo Companion – daily summon (custom feature, stats TBD)
- Fifth Mutineer – complicated feelings; gave up Iron Jack’s location
- Parents – wealthy coastal merchants, still write letters

### Enemies
- [[Players & Backstories/Iron Jack]] – primary target, currently hiding in the Dustveil

### Goals
- **Short-term:** Confront Iron Jack before his 30-day sanctuary expires (day 5/30 now)
- **Medium-term:** Learn Morrigan’s true nature and the meaning of her symbol
- **Long-term:** Reclaim or destroy the *Dreadful Shadow*

### Secrets
**Wyatt knows:** The mutiny wasn’t really about him — Iron Jack had already sold the ship to an unknown third party.

**DM only:** The tattoo companion occasionally returns with trinkets dusted in Skyfall salt, etched with Wilds runes, or still warm from an aethersteel forge. The closer Wyatt gets to the Maw, the stranger (and more valuable) these items become.
