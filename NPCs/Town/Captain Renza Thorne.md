# Captain Renza Thorne

**Tags:** #npc/town #span-wardens #leader

Human female, early 40s. Tall, scarred, left eye a patch of etched aethersteel (functional but creepy). Carries a salt-forged halberd named “Last March.”

**Personality:** Duty above all. Fair, but zero patience for chaos.  
**Quote:** “Thirty days is mercy. Day thirty-one is mine.”

## Session 3 Updates
- Interrogated party about the self-drawing map; recognized its military value for the Iron Dominion war
- Offered **30,000 gold** for the map (declined)
- Warned party: wardens saw the map, word will spread fast — *"You just became the most interesting people in Umbergate. That is not a compliment."*
- Paid party **500 gold** for the patrol rescue (300 base + 200 survivor bonus)
- Confirmed Wyatt's quarry is likely still in town under protection
- Admitted she's never entered the Maw — *"I didn't really want to go"*
- Saw the party return as Marked — *"Well, marked already. You three don't waste time, do you?"*
- Session 3 ended with her asking what they saw — but the spoiler curse means they *can't* tell her specifics

**Secrets (DM only)**
> [!secret]
> - Her eye was taken by one of Nyx’s early “perfect” subjects.
> - Quietly recruiting anyone who’s been inside the Maw — planning a pre-emptive strike if the war reaches the Span.
