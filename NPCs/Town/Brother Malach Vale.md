Human male, 30s. Right arm replaced wrist-to-shoulder with flawless aethersteel that flexes like living flesh.

Brother Malach Vale, gaunt human male in his early 50s, pale almost translucent skin, fanatical ice-blue eyes that seem to glow, long white hair falling to waist, wearing flowing white robes with subtle metallic thread that catches light like spider-silk, right hand and forearm replaced by flawless mirror-bright aethersteel that perfectly reflects everything around him

**Personality:** Charismatic, serene, utterly convinced mortality is a sin.  
**Quote:** “Flesh is temporary. Steel is eternal.”
