# Old Markham (First of the Marked)

**Tags:** #npc/town #marked #broken-span-inn #living-legend

**Full Name:** Markham Thorne (no relation to Captain Renza – the coincidence amuses him on bad days)

Human male, late 50s (looks 80). Skin like cracked saddle leather, salt-dust in every crease, iron-grey hair tied back with a frayed blue ribbon. Right palm always wrapped in a greasy rag that leaks faint violet light between the threads. Voice is a wet rasp – half his throat was torn out long ago and never quite healed.

## First Impression (read-aloud the moment players enter the Broken Span Inn)
> In the corner booth, under a lantern that refuses to light his face properly, sits an old man who feels like he was waiting for you before you were born.  
> A rag-bound hand rests on the table; soft purple pulses throb beneath the cloth like a dying star.  
> When your eyes meet, he lifts one corner of the rag just long enough to reveal the glowing sigil branded into his palm and croaks,  
> “Still hurts after twenty-seven years. Means the Boy ain’t done with me yet.”

## Personality
- Speaks slowly – every word costs him  
- Alternates between kindly grandfather and thousand-yard-stare veteran  
- Calls Prime Alrec Vane **“the Boy”** with equal parts terror and exhausted pity  
- Laughs exactly once per conversation: short, wet, humourless

**Why “the Boy”?**  
When Markham met Vane, the archmage chose to appear as a lonely eight-year-old child in oversized sapphire robes, playing cards with ghosts. That image is burned deeper than the sigil itself. Other Marked swear they saw a grown man, an ancient sage, or worse – Markham just rasps, “He was a boy to me. Still is.”

## Mannerisms & Voice
- Raspy whisper, like gravel poured over broken glass  
- Constantly fingers the rag  
- Refers to the Maw as “the house” and Vane as “the Boy who never grew up”

## Common Lines (pick or roll)
1. “I was the first soul He ever let back out. Don’t know of any before me, and the Boy never told.”  
2. “Don’t trust the ones that come back smiling. They left the worst parts inside.”  
3. “The Boy likes games. Worst kind – the ones you don’t know you’re playing.”  
4. “Want advice? Don’t go. Want the truth? You already decided the moment you looked west.”

## What Everyone Knows
- Believes himself the first soul ever let back out (~27 years ago); rasps, “I was the first. Don’t know of any before me, and the Boy never told.”  
- Hasn’t crossed the Span since the day he crawled back missing half his voice  
- Lives rent-free at the Broken Span; Ma Jessa keeps his corner booth sacred  
- When his palm flares bright under the rag, something bad crosses the bridge within the hour

## Useful Knowledge (shares only if he likes you)
- The sigil burns hotter the closer you are to something Vane wants watched  
- There are floors in the Maw where sound dies and thoughts echo aloud  
- Aethersteel remembers the hand that mined it (Torvek’s arm sometimes points west on its own)  
- Vane’s real voice sounds like a child asking you to stay for dinner… forever

## Secrets (DM only)
> [!secret]
> - He is actually the **third** person to return alive. The two before him vanished or died silently; Vane told Markham he was “the first worth keeping” and let him believe it ever since.  
> - The rag hides spreading violet-glass veins; early Glass Plague fused with the sigil. When it reaches his heart, Vane will “reel him in.”  
> - Keeps a single aethersteel token Vane gave him “for the way home.” Press it to the Maw’s gate → opens straight to Vane’s private study… and settles the final debt.

## Boons for Parties Who Earn His Trust
- Once per session: lets a PC press their palm to his → grants Inspiration + a one-sentence warning about the next danger  
- If they ever protect Ma Jessa or the Inn: limps to the Span with them and mutters, “Tell the Boy… Markham’s still waiting on that rematch.” (Vane recognises the name; party gets one encounter of oddly gentle treatment)  
- If they bring him something from “the card-table floor,” he weeps silently and hands over the aethersteel token (priceless… or a one-way ticket)

## Stats (only if he’s forced to fight – he won’t want to)
Old Markham – CR 2 (450 XP)  
HP 65, AC 12 (no armor left in him)  
**Marked Palm** – once per day can force a Wild Magic Surge centered on himself as a reaction  
**Legendary Resistance** (1/day) – “The Boy’s not done with me yet.”
