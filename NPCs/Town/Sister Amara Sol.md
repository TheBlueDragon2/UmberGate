# Sister Amara Sol

**Tags:** #npc/town #vigil-hospice #cleric #vigil-of-lorris

**Full Name:** Amara Solari (half-elf, sun-touched lineage)

Half-elf female, appears mid-30s. Auburn hair in a tight braid, dawn-gold robes stained with salt and old blood, holy symbol a rising sun forged from aethersteel wire around her neck. Calm face with faint scars across knuckles; eyes like polished amber—warm until they aren't.

## First Impression (read-aloud when players enter the Hospice)
> Sister Amara stands at the center of the quiet ward, laying hands on a moaning salt miner. Golden light flares from her palms, knitting shattered bone. She looks up, smiles gently, and says,  
> “Lorris welcomes the weary. What breaks you that I might mend?”  
> Her voice carries over the room's soft groans, but her free hand rests near a concealed mace at her belt—steady, ready.

## Personality
- Compassionate healer who chooses peace every time... because she *knows* the cost of violence intimately  
- Pragmatic to her core: mercy for the repentant, steel for the monstrous  
- **Core Philosophy (her quote):** “True peace is not weakness. It is the strength to shatter worlds... and the wisdom to sheath the blade.”  
  *(She lives this: capable of holy fury, but only unleashes it to protect the helpless.)*

## Mannerisms & Voice
- Voice: Soft alto with a healer's cadence—calming, but edges harden like drawn steel  
- Gentle touches; always positions herself between patients and threats  
- Fingers trace her sun symbol when weighing judgment

## Common Lines (pick or roll)
1. “Lorris mends what men break. But some fractures demand a hammer first.”  
2. “I've walked battlefields where glass rained from the sky. Peace is my vow... not my limit.”  
3. “The Glass Plague takes slowly. Let me ease it—before it takes you entirely.”  
4. “Ask, and I heal. Threaten my charges, and you meet the dawn's wrath.”

## What Everyone Knows
- Beloved cleric running the Vigil Hospice; heals miners, Plague victims, and war-wounded for free  
- Can stabilize Glass Plague (slows it, never cures)  
- Former battlefield healer in the Crimson Accord war; deserted after “something broke her”  
- Whispers say she's killed before—and would again without hesitation

## Useful Knowledge (shares freely to help)
- Glass Plague spreads via Wilds spores; aethersteel dust halts it temporarily  
- Nyx “cured” some early on... then twisted them into abominations  
- Vigil wards repel minor Wilds surges; press a sun-symbol for sanctuary  
- “The Marked carry more than scars. Their palms warn of what's coming.”

## Secrets (DM only)
> [!secret]
> - **Lovers with Nyx:** They were secret lovers 4 months ago—Amara saw the good doctor who saved her life from Plague exposure. His Vane-essence warp shattered him; watching him replace her aethersteel-laced heart with cold metal *broke her soul*. She helped exile him to save the town (and herself).  
> - Deserted war after glassing a village: channeled Lorris' dawnfire, slaughtered the platoon alone. Vowed peace—but keeps “Dawn's Reckoning” mace (+1 flame, once/day 10d6 radiant burst, DC 17 Dex half).  
> - Hidden basement: 3 Nyx victims in stasis (studying for Plague cure; one whispers her name in sleep).  
> - Carries one vial of Vane’s essence (stolen from Marked)—town's last resort.

## Boons for Trusted Parties
- **Free Healing:** Full services; Lesser Restoration 1/day on Glass Plague  
- **Sanctuary Vow:** Once, escorts/guarantees safe passage (even post-30 days)  
- **Dawn's Mercy:** If Hospice defended, joins fight: CR 5 Cleric ally  
- **Nyx Insight:** Sketches show patterns (“He’s building steel saints... for what?”)
