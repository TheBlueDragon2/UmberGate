"One" trench-coated human(oid), 8 ft tall. Actually **three kobold brothers** stacked: **Tink** (top, Cha 16, silver tongue), **Quill** (middle, Int 16, ledger genius), **Brunt** (bottom, Str 16, hauls crates). Coordinate flawlessly; coat hides tails/scales.

**Personality:** Friendly, efficient, paranoid about discovery. Tink haggles smoothly; Quill mutters math; Brunt grunts loads.  
**Voice:** Booming baritone (Tink ventriloquizing); faint squeaks if coat shifts.  
**Quote:** "Fair trade for fair folk — Span or no!"

**Stats (as one CR 1/2 NPC):** AC 13 (coat), HP 33, Str/Cha +3, Int +3. *Sling stones* (ranged), *tail swipe* (melee, Brunt). Escape: Coat unravels, three kobolds flee separately (Dex saves).

## Session 3 Interaction
- First in-person encounter with the party. Sold rations, trinkets, and puzzle toys.
- **Tink** (top) did all the talking — enthusiastic about the trinket cabinet, booming baritone voice, very friendly. Got excited when Galaric asked for trinkets ("Most people aren't looking for trinkets!") and revealed a hidden, immaculately organized cabinet sorted by color and type.
- **Physical tells noticed by party:** Tail visible from behind, arm reaching from middle of body, head turning independently of torso, disjointed limb coordination. Galaric (Perception 16) caught most of it; others missed it.
- **Party reaction:** Characters didn't fully figure it out — chalked it up to "reptilian, maybe cold-blooded, hence the trenchcoat." Decided to let it go. Players figured it out instantly and loved it.
- **Agreed to watch for black powder** from southern caravans for Harey's pistol ammunition.
- **Town's unspoken rule:** Everyone knows. Nobody says anything. The brothers run a good, honest store and that's what matters in Umbergate.

**Secrets (DM only)**
> [!secret]
> - Exiled from eastern kobold warrens for "stealing shine" (aethersteel bait).
> - Dream of buying a real shop east — but Wilds pay too well.
> - Quill deciphers Vane's sigils; Tink mimics Marked palms for discounts.
