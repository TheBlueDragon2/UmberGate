## Description (read-aloud for encounters)
> A figure materializes in a ripple of violet heat—robes swirling with impossible colors, eyes like shattered prisms reflecting worlds that shouldn't exist. He giggles, a sound like breaking glass and child's delight. "Oh, what delightful little sparks you've brought me today. Shall we play?"

## Personality
- Playful cruelty: Treats lives as experiments; curiosity overrides morality.
- Voice: Loki-like giggle, whimsical riddles.
- Quote: "Rules? Oh, darling, I broke those centuries ago. Now, let's see what breaks in you."

## Known History (public legend)
- 400 years ago: Youngest High Arcanist of the Sapphire Conclave.
- Heroically stopped the Night of Unravelled Veils, saving the Pale Reach.
- Demanded (and received) all lands west of the Fracture as reward: "No laws, no limits, just me and magic."

## Maw Mechanics
- Entry: Raise right hand; Vane decides. Approved get faint glowing sigil on palm (the Marked).
- Survivors: Emerge with aethersteel, changed forever.

## Rumors (d6, town hearsay)
1. "Vane's not human anymore— he's the Wilds incarnate."
2. "He picks delvers based on their secrets; the Maw reveals all."
3. "Some nights, his giggle echoes across the Fracture."
4. "The aethersteel is his blood, distilled."
5. "Nyx stole a vial from him—that's what started the madness."

## Secrets (DM only)
> [!secret]
> - Spent 400 years deliberately dismantling magic: Opened permanent rifts to Feywild, Far Realm, Limbo, etc., letting planes bleed into the Wilds.
> - Created the Wilds' chaos on purpose—riot of colors, surges, bizarre life.
> - Maw is his personal lab and front door; insanity complete, curiosity infinite.
> - Cruelty and kindness indistinguishable; delvers are toys/test subjects.
