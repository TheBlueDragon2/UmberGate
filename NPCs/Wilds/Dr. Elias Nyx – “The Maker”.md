### Roleplaying notes
- Still believes he is humanity’s saviour.  
- Uses patients’ names, offers “the gift” before violence.  
- Will paralyse and convert rather than kill outright.  
- On death: injects final ichor, smiles sadly, whispers “Flesh fails again.”

### Complete canonical history (public & secret)

**Before the fall**  
- Beloved Dustveil physician who ran **Elias’s Rest**, a free clinic.  
- Old treatment: skyfall-salt infusion + rare herbs + bloodletting → halted Glass Plague progression for months/years but never reversed it. He despised it as “delaying the inevitable with knives.”

**~6 months ago** – Mutated plague wave hits. Old methods useless. Twelve children dying.

**Public declaration** (carved into his clinic doorframe)  
“My knowledge of medicine has reached its limits. I must find new knowledge.”

**~5½ months ago** – Crosses the Span alone, enters the Maw, missing 3 days. Returns gloved (hiding palm-mark) with one crystal vial of Vane’s opalescent ichor.

**~5 months ago** – Injects the twelve children. Plague fully reverses in 48 hours. Town celebrates.

**~4½ months ago** – Relapse, black crystal returns worse. Two children die.  
Elias discovers powdered aethersteel permanently binds ichor in vitro.  
Begins preaching openly in market and taverns:

> “The ichor is not just a cure for the Glass Plague.  
> It is the cure for all disease, for aging, for death itself.  
> Flesh rejects perfection. Replace the failing parts with vessels of living aethersteel and the cure becomes eternal.”

**~4 months ago** – Escalation. Eleven stable grafts (including Brother Malach Vale’s arm). Failures mount; patients left mid-surgery when anesthetics run out.

**~3½ months ago** – A woman wakes mid-procedure (arm & leg replaced, torso unstable). Chews through straps, crawls to the Broken Span Inn trailing blood and metal.  
Mob led by Captain Renza Thorne storms Elias’s Rest: four unfinished bodies, walls covered in charts titled “Stages of Ascension – Toward the Deathless Form.”  
Nyx had fled at dawn with his only three stable successes:

- “Iron Jonas” – both legs  
- “Mercy” – left arm + ribcage plating  
- “Stillborn” – entire torso cage, speaks in metallic clicks

A salt-dust storm hid their crossing. Thorne’s wardens arrived minutes too late.

**Current town split**  
- Most of Umbergate: “He was the best of us and he broke.”  
- The Reborn Path (~20 followers): “He was right. Flesh is the disease. He will finish the work.”
