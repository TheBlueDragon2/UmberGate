# Esmerelda

**Tags:** #npc/wilds #hag #mysterious #maw-connected

**Race:** Hag (type TBD — green hag or something older?)  
**Status:** Alive, dwelling in the Umberwilds  
**Location:** Inside a living tree ~1 day west of the Span (door vanishes after visitors leave)

## Appearance & First Impression
Initially appeared as a stereotypical hag — older lady, elongated nose, rough hair, decent but not pristine clothes. Saw the players' faces and shifted form right in front of them: "Oh, I'm sorry. You would probably prefer this." Changed to a pleasant-looking woman, roughly 30s, approximately an 8/10. Later shifted again mid-conversation to a mid-40s male form — completely unbothered, as if changing clothes. The shapeshifting itself was the power move — she doesn't hide what she is, she just doesn't care enough to make you uncomfortable. Or she does, and this is part of the game.

**Voice:** Conversational, casual. Speaks like someone who has all the time in the world and finds you mildly interesting.

## Personality
- **Utterly unconcerned.** The party is no threat to her and she knows it. Not arrogant — just factual, like a human watching ants
- **Sharp.** Recognized each PC's quirks and nature almost immediately. Reads people like open books
- **Pleasant.** Conversational, even warm — but the warmth of someone who finds you *interesting*, not someone who cares about your wellbeing
- **Sees potential.** Views the party as something potentially useful later. Not now — later. She's patient
- Spoke freely about the Maw and its role in shaping the Umberwilds — notably more open than any Marked NPC the party has encountered
- Not hostile, not overtly helpful — an observer who occasionally participates

## What She Told the Party (Session 2)
- The Maw is responsible for the magical nature of the Umberwilds
- *(Add any other details from the session)*

## The Tree Lair
- Hidden door embedded in a massive tree in the Umberwilds
- Interior: books (mostly homemade, focused on nature), potions, shelves, tables
- Door vanishes after visitors exit — once people know where she is, she moves. Always. The location is never the same twice
- This is instinct, not paranoia — something (or someone) taught her that being findable is dangerous
- The tree itself had three swollen "wounds" containing the missing Warden patrol — were the blights her guardians? Her experiments? Something attracted to the tree?

## Key Question: The Blights
The twig blights and treeblights the party fought were surrounding her tree, seemingly tending to the cocooned patrolmen. She showed no concern about the patrol or the blights. Possible interpretations:
- **They're hers** — she was studying the patrol, or collecting them, or "preserving" them in her own way
- **They're the Wilds'** — the tree absorbed the patrol naturally; the blights are parasites or caretakers she tolerates but doesn't control
- **They're Vane's** — another layer of his observation network, and Esmerelda just lives alongside them
- **She genuinely didn't care** — they were incidental to her. The patrol wandered into her territory and the Wilds did what the Wilds do

## Connection to Vane (DM brainstorm — not yet canon)
She spoke freely about the Maw without any sign of the Silence geas. This means one of:
1. She's not Marked — she knows about the Maw through other means (age, observation, Vane told her directly)
2. She predates Vane's rules — she was in the Wilds before he reshaped them
3. She's part of his system — an unofficial agent, observer, or symbiotic presence he permits
4. She has leverage over Vane — knows something that grants her immunity
5. Vane *wants* her talking — she's a controlled information leak, feeding select visitors just enough to draw them deeper

## Connection to Thorne
Captain Thorne reacted to Esmerelda's name with recognition — frustration, not surprise. She knows *of* Esmerelda. Possible reasons:
- Previous patrols have reported encountering her (she's a known Wilds figure)
- Thorne has intelligence on Wilds entities and Esmerelda is on the list
- Thorne has had direct dealings with her in the past (before the party arrived)
- Esmerelda has interfered with Warden operations before — the patrol being absorbed into her tree would support this
- *(Ryan: decide how deep Thorne's knowledge goes — casual awareness vs. personal history)*

## Relationship to Thistledown
**None — different planes.** Thistledown is Feywild. Esmerelda is material plane (Umberwilds). The Wilds bleed Feywild energy due to Vane's rifts, but they are still the material plane. These are two entirely separate hags in entirely separate domains.
*(If a connection ever makes sense, it would be through the planar bleed — but not established and not needed.)*

## Secrets (DM only)
> [!secret]
> - Connection to Vane: TBD (see brainstorm above — strongest option: she predates or parallels his reshaping of the Wilds, tolerated because she's useful or amusing)
> - Connection to Thorne: Thorne knows her by reputation at minimum — prior patrols have reported "the old woman in the trees." Thorne's frustration suggests this isn't the first time Esmerelda has been entangled with Warden operations
> - Relationship to Dr. Nyx: Unknown — but she lives in the same Wilds he's hiding in. Does she know where his camp is? Has she met him? Does she find his work interesting or repulsive?
> - The vanishing door: Her magic. She relocates after being found — always. The "why" is still a mystery
> - **Power level:** Far beyond the party. She's not a combat encounter — she's a force of nature who occasionally has conversations

*Status: Core entry complete. Needs finalized physical description for "pleasant" form, voice/quotes, and decisions on Vane/Thistledown connections.*
