# Whispering Ingot
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This thumb-sized bar of aethersteel thrums with a faint metallic heartbeat. While attuned:

- As a **bonus action** once per short rest, your next weapon attack deals an extra **1d4 force damage**.
- Once unlocked (see Session 01 puzzle), it contains a single-use vial of aethersteel dust that suppresses Glass Plague symptoms for 1d4 days.

*Flavor:* When held to the ear, faint giggling can sometimes be heard — Prime Alrec Vane’s distant amusement.
