DM Tip: When players ask around, roll 1d6: 1–3 one rumor, 4–5 two rumors, 6 a rumor + small complication (drunk challenger, eavesdropper, etc.). Let them chase the ones that bite their backstories. - Roll or pick. These are what floats around Umbergate taverns, markets, and hospice beds. Most are half-true, exaggerated, or flat wrong – perfect for player hooks without spoiling secrets.
