# UMBERGATE & THE WILDS – MASTER DOCUMENT  
(Current as of 30 November 2025 – demiplane canon locked, all previous updates preserved)

### Core Geography & Names
- Town: **Umbergate** (“the Gate”) – pop. ~2,900 and growing
- The mile-deep gorge: **the Fracture** (both the chasm and the ancient cataclysm)
- Bridge: **Anchorspan** (“the Span”)
- Everything west of the Span: **the Umberwilds** (“the Wilds”)
  - Magic is wild, unpredictable, vivid faewild colours, impossible flora/fauna
  - Simply “how the Wilds are”
- Megadungeon entrance: **the Maw** (~1,000 yards past the Span)
  - Rippling mirage-like gate
  - Controlled by **Prime Alrec Vane**, the High Arcanist (youngest ever, now centuries old and utterly mad)
  - Entry: raise right hand; Vane chooses. Survivors receive a faintly glowing arcane sigil on the right palm
  - Vane speaks in a playful, giggling, child-like voice; delvers are his toys

### TRUE NATURE OF THE MAW (DM ONLY – never tell players outright)
The Maw is **not** a megadungeon.  
It is a permanently anchored, heavily modified 9th-level **Demiplane** spell that Vane has been expanding and reshaping for 400 years.  
- Vane is the absolute god inside his plane: gravity, time, memory, and physics obey his whim.  
- The rippling gate = the permanent door.  
- The sigil = Vane’s personal brand so he always recognises return visitors.  
- Shifting floors, impossible geometry, rooms that remember you, card-table floors, tea parties with childhood fears = trivial for the caster inside his own demiplane.  
- The silence geas is a built-in rule: “No spoilers outside my playhouse.”  
- Aethersteel only exists here because Vane seeded the plane with self-repairing veins centuries ago (his private laboratory stock).

### Prime Alrec Vane – True History (unknown to the town)
- 400 years ago: youngest High Arcanist of the Sapphire Conclave
- Single-handedly stopped the Night of Unravelled Veils
- Reward demanded: “Give me all lands west of the Fracture. No laws, no limits.”
- Pale Concord granted it and drew the Fracture as the legal boundary
- Spent four centuries deliberately dismantling every rule of magic:
  - Tore open permanent doorways to Feywild, Far Realm, Limbo, etc.
  - Let the planes bleed together on purpose
  - Created the riot of colour, wild surges, and impossible creatures
- The Maw is his personal laboratory and front door
- Insanity complete; curiosity infinite; cruelty and kindness indistinguishable
- Appearance shifts at whim (child, sage, horror) depending on who he’s playing with

### The Miracle Metal
- **Aethersteel** – neutral, self-repairing, ultra magic-conductive, extra attunement slots
- Found ONLY inside the Maw
- Powdered form temporarily halts the Glass Plague

### Dr. Elias Nyx (“the Maker”)
- 3–4 months ago: beloved physician
- Entered the Maw, obtained one vial of Vane’s distilled essence/blood
- Used it to cure many Glass Plague victims
- Exposure + Wilds warped his mind
- Obsessed with ending mortality by turning people into sentient metal constructs
- Began forced limb/organ replacement → discovered → mob exiled him
- Now deep in the Wilds (NOT in the Maw) running a hidden camp of full-body experiments
- No redemption possible
- Former secret lover of Sister Amara Sol (her greatest shame and lingering heartbreak)

### Economy
- Skyfall salt mining (pale-blue preservative crystals)
- 30-day sanctuary clause for fugitives
- Aethersteel is the true jackpot (one ingot = merchant’s fortune, one dagger arms a champion)

### Wider World
- Westernmost settlement of the **Pale Reach**
- Pale Reach = loose confederation of city-states (the “Seven”)
- Current war: **War of the Crimson Accord** vs. the Iron Dominion (6 years, Reach losing)
- South along the Verge: Cinderfall (3 days) → Last Ford (7–8 days) → Thornmouth (12–14 days)

### The Marked – Current Canon (town culture)
- 22–28 living Marked in Umbergate at any time
- Silence Pact: describing deeper layers = words turn to glass in throat (DC 15 Wis save or choke)
- Palm-clasp = 60-second telepathic flash (safe sharing)
- Old Markham believes himself the first to return (~27 years ago); actually the third
