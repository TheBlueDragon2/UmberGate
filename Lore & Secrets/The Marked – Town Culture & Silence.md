# The Marked – Town Culture & Silence

**Tags:** #lore #marked #town

## How Many & Who They Are (Goldilocks numbers)
- Total living Marked in Umbergate at any one time: **22–28**  
- 10–12 regulars (always in town): Old Markham, Nov “Nine-Fingers”, etc.  
- 8–10 “runners” (treasure hunters who come and go)  
- 3–5 fresh or broken (hiding at the Inn or Hospice)  
- Turnover: 2–3 new attempts per month, ~1 returns alive, ~1 leaves rich and vanishes east

## The Silence Pact – Why They Don’t Talk
Any Marked who tries to describe the Maw’s deeper layers feels words turn to glass in the throat (roleplay: DC 15 Wis save or choke on blood-flecked crystal for 1 minute).  
Four reasons (they’ll hint at these instead of spilling):

1. **The Sigil’s Geas** – Vane’s playful compulsion; spoilers ruin his games.  
2. **Punishment is Personal** – Next trip in, the Maw “remembers” loose lips (gravity reverses, memories become hostile NPCs, etc.).  
3. **Only Other Marked Understand** – Non-Marked hear madness; Marked hear truth.  
4. **Practical Survival** – Bragging brings thieves, Reborn recruiters, or Warden audits.

Read-aloud when two Marked meet and the party eavesdrops:  
> They touch glowing palms. Violet light flares between their hands like a heartbeat. One leans in and whispers a single sentence too low to catch. The other’s eyes widen, then both nod once and release. No more words are needed.

## The Palm-Clasp (secret handshake)
When two Marked press sigils together for 3 seconds they share a 60-second telepathic flash – one concrete Maw fact or memory can be exchanged safely, no save required. Outsiders just see the light show.

## Visible After-Effects Table (d6, roll secretly when a Marked removes glove/rag)
| d6 | Physical Tell | What It Hints At |
|------|---------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Sigil vines crawl 2–6 inches up wrist/forearm | Went past Layer 3 |
| 2 | Pupils flicker violet in torchlight | Looked Vane in the eyes |
| 3 | Missing small item (ring, tooth, lock of hair) | Paid a “toll” inside |
| 4 | Random giggle mid-sentence, then horrified silence | Echoes Vane’s laugh |
| 5 | Palm flares painfully near raw aethersteel | Hoarding too much |
| 6 | Whispers to an empty corner when stressed | Still talking to something that followed them out |

## Marked Hangouts & Benefits
- **Broken Span Inn** – back booth is sacred ground (Old Markham’s table)  
- **Laughing Maw council room** – fight for entry rights, pool tithes, plan runs  
- **Dustveil safe-house** – unmarked shack where fresh Marked hide from recruiters

Boon for parties who earn trust (once per long rest, one Marked ally can grant):  
**Whisper-Net Warning** – “Something with too many mouths is crossing tonight” or “The Boy’s bored—expect tricks tomorrow.”

Paste this anywhere (I recommend appending it to Locations/Town/The Broken Span Inn.md under a new ## The Marked Regulars header, or make its own lore file).  
Depth added, zero contradiction, ready for tonight’s table.
