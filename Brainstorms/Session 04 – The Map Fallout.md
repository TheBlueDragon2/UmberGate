# Session 04 Brainstorm – The Map Fallout
**Status:** Ideas only — not yet built out. QC with Ryan first.

## Setup
After Session 3 (Carnival of Trials), the party returned Marked and showed Captain Thorne the automapper parchment from Omar's Whispering Box. Thorne reacted strongly — cleared the room, but not before guards saw her excitement.

## Thorne's Reaction
- Recognizes it as Maw-origin, possibly Vane's craftsmanship. A real-time updating Wilds map could be critical if the Iron Dominion reaches the Fracture
- Wants to keep it secret — but she reacted too fast. The damage is done
- May offer the party something valuable for discretion: Warden protection, aethersteel vault access, intel on their personal quests

## The Leak — Who Saw, Who Talks
- **Iron Tithe guard** — reports to Korr. He wants it for leverage or sale
- **Reborn sympathizer among wardens** — tells Malach. If it's Vane's work, it's "sacred"
- **Omar's network** — picks it up within hours. Furious/fascinated his box held something that valuable. Feels cheated, wants to renegotiate
- **Silent Cal** — sees profit. Knows buyers east who'd pay a fortune

## The Rumor Spiral (escalation over in-game days)
- **Day 1:** "The new Marked showed Thorne something that made her clear the room"
- **Day 2:** "It's a map. From the Maw. It moves on its own"
- **Day 3:** "It's worth more than the entire salt harvest" — exaggerated to artifact level
- **Day 4:** Attempts begin

## Who Might Move on the Party
- **Iron Tithe thugs** — Korr sends collectors. "Ten percent of all goods. Including that parchment." Straightforward shakedown
- **Reborn Path** — Malach approaches with honeyed words first. "A gift from the Boy belongs in sacred hands." If refused, zealots get aggressive
- **Fractal Consortium** — Factor Lysa Vell makes a sophisticated offer. Money, connections, protection. The civilized threat
- **A lone Marked** — desperate or broken, knows what a Maw artifact means. Sympathetic antagonist — needs it to survive, not profit
- **Omar himself** — realizes he was played by Vane, wants back in on the deal. Not hostile, but persistent. Could become ally or problem

## The Vane Connection (deeper layer)
- Vane *wanted* this to happen. The box reached the right hands. The map is a leash — he's watching through it, amused, feeding them just enough to keep coming back
- The compass needle starts twitching toward things Vane wants them to find — helping or herding?
- Ties into "the restless stir" — Vane needs capable agents and he's grooming them

## Player Agency Angles
- Do they hide it, flaunt it, sell copies, use it as leverage?
- Do they confront Omar about the box's true origin?
- Do they trust Thorne or suspect she'll confiscate it?
- If they figure out Vane planted it — do they feel used or empowered?

## Box Origin (DM secret)
Vane placed the box with Omar. Omar doesn't know Vane was the source — he thinks it was a random smuggler who never returned. Vane engineered the whole chain: box → Omar → party. The map and compass are tracking devices as much as gifts.
