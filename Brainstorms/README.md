# Brainstorms

Ideas, half-baked plots, and "what if" threads. Nothing here is canon until Ryan approves it and it gets built into the main vault.

## How This Works
1. Jarvis and Ryan brainstorm here
2. Ryan QCs and approves ideas
3. Approved ideas get built into full vault entries (Sessions, NPCs, Quests, etc.)
4. Old brainstorm files stay as design history

## Active Brainstorms
