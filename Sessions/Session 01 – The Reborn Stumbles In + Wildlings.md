# Session 01 – The Reborn Stumbles In + Wildlings
**Designed for:** 3–6 players, levels 1–2  
**Tone:** Immediate chaos → town immersion → first taste of the Wilds  
**Length:** 2–3 hours (perfect Session 1)

## 0 – Cold Open (read the second everyone sits down)
> Salt dust stings your eyes as you step off the swaying Anchorspan into Umbergate.  
> The Keep looms on your right, banners snapping like breaking bones. The Wall of Remembrance whispers names on your left. Ahead, Wall Road funnels you into a riot of shouting hawkers, war refugees, and Marked toughs with glowing palms.  
> The wind smells of ozone and impossible flowers that don’t exist east of the Fracture.  
> Welcome to the edge of the world.

Ask each player in one sentence: **“Why can’t you leave Umbergate yet?”**  
Write their answers down — you’ll use them in 10 minutes.

## 1 – The Reborn Stumbles In (0–20 min)
Read aloud:

> The Caravan Market erupts in screams.  
> A figure staggers out of the shimmering heat at the Wilds end of the Span — human-shaped, but wrong.  
> His skin is marbled with veins of living glass that crack and bleed light. One arm ends in a jagged crystalline stump. His eyes are milk-white.  
> “The Maker… promised… eternity…” he gurgles, then collapses in the dust right in front of you, oil-black blood pooling beneath him.

Immediate chaos (roll initiative or just let players shout actions):

- 4 × **Iron Tithe Thugs** (use Bandit stats, CR 1/8) try to loot the body (“Tithe takes its cut!”)  
- 3 × **Reborn Zealots** (use Cult Fanatic stats, CR 2, non-metal yet) form a protective ring, chanting “Flesh is sin!”  
- **Captain Renza Thorne** (from the Keep wall) bellows: “You lot — earn your keep!”

Combat: 2–3 rounds max.  
If the Reborn survives 3 rounds he gasps:

> “Deep… in the groves… the Maker still cuts…”

**Loot on body:** cracked vial of powdered aethersteel dust (1 dose = halts Glass Plague progression for 1 month)

## 2 – Aftermath & Faction Offers (20–40 min)
- **Captain Renza Thorne** offers 50 gp + Warden favor to anyone who’ll scout the near Wilds at dawn.  
- **Brother Malach Vale** glides in, offers free healing at the Reborn Chapel.  
- **“Honest” Omar** appears: “That name — ‘the Maker’ — is Dr. Elias Nyx. Want to know where that poor bastard came from? 25 gp.”

## 3 – Wildlings! (40–70 min)
Just as the crowd calms:

> A horn blasts from the Keep — three short, one long.  
> “WILDLINGS! Pack incoming — close the Span!”

6 × **Wildlings** (stats below) sprint across the bridge, drawn by blood.

**Wildling** (reskinned Wolf)  
Medium aberration, chaotic neutral  
AC 13 ⋮ HP 22 ⋮ Speed 40 ft.  
Bite +4 (1d6+2 piercing + 1d4 psychic; DC 12 Wis save or frightened until end of next turn)

The party fights alongside 6–8 Span Wardens. Perfect heroic moment.

## Session End Hook
After the fight, Captain Thorne steps forward:

> “That pack didn’t wander here by chance. Something — or someone — is stirring the Wilds.  
> I need volunteers to scout the near groves at first light. 200 gp up front, plus whatever you salvage.  
> Who’s in?”

They’ll say yes. Session 2 opens with them crossing the Span for the first time.

## DM Secrets
- The dying Reborn was one of Nyx’s early “successes” — sent back as a living warning.  
- The Wildling attack was subtly lured (a faint Vane giggle on the wind if anyone succeeds on a DC 18 Perception check).
