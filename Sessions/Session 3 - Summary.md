## Recap (Session 2 → 3 Bridge)

Session 2 ended with the party returning from the Umberwilds with one surviving patrolman (a private — the sergeant and the other private didn't make it). They met [[Esmerelda]] the hag in a hidden tree-hollow library. Upon reporting to [[Captain Renza Thorne|Captain Thorne]], Galaric inadvertently revealed the **self-drawing map** in front of wardens. Thorne cleared the room.

---

## Key Events (Chronological)

### 1. The Map Conversation with Thorne (The Keep)
- Thorne interrogated the party about the map's origin and capabilities
- The party explained they got it from [[Honest Omar|Omar's]] box; Omar likely didn't know what was inside
- Thorne explained the map's **strategic military value** — real-time battlefield mapping for the war against the **Iron Dominion**
- She warned them: **at least two wardens saw the map draw itself**. By sundown the market will know, by tomorrow Omar will know, and then *everyone* knows
- Her advice: *"Keep it hidden. If anyone asks, it's a souvenir, a trinket, nothing more."*
- She offered **30,000 gold** if they ever want to sell — party declined for now
- Thorne confirmed the person Wyatt is tracking is **likely still in town** and under the 30-day protection clock
- **The compass** from the Whispering Box was NOT shown to Thorne

### 2. Shopping at Hargrove's General Store
- The party visited [[The Hargrove Brothers|Hargrove's General Store]] — their first in-person interaction with "Hargrove," who is actually **three kobold brothers in a trenchcoat** (Tink/Quill/Brunt). The town knows and nobody says a word — it's an unspoken agreement.
- The transcript is loaded with tells the players picked up on: disjointed arm movements, a tail poking out the back, an arm reaching from the *middle* of the body, the head turning independently of the torso, and uncoordinated limb movements. Galaric (Perception 16) noticed the most — saw the tail and the disjointed body. Harey and Wyatt (Perception 5) were oblivious at first.
- The players clocked it out-of-character immediately but the *characters* didn't fully put it together — Galaric noted "something weird" but didn't press. Post-visit, Galaric asked Harey *"Did Hargrove feel weird to you?"* and they speculated about reptilian cold-bloodedness explaining the trenchcoat. They decided to let it go — *"Nice enough."*
- **The trinket cabinet** was a standout moment — "Hargrove" got genuinely excited showing off an immaculately organized collection (by color, type, material) hidden behind a panel. The trinkets are clearly a passion project for the brothers, contrasting with the averagely-organized general store.
- Galaric purchased **20 days of rations** (20 gold) and **2 trinkets/puzzles** (~3 gold) for Ilira and her mother
- Galaric also set aside **30 gold** to leave at the hovel for emergencies
- **Harey asked about pistol bullets** — the brothers had no idea what a gun was (*"Small rocks maybe?"*); suggested the smithy
- Wyatt described his quarry to Hargrove — no luck, "slightly shorter buff dark-haired shifty guy" fits half the town
- Hargrove mentioned **[[Exile's Pit|The Exile's Pit]]** as a gathering place for entertainment
- **Later:** Harey swung back to ask Hargrove to watch for **black powder** from incoming caravans — they agreed to keep an eye out

### 3. Visit to The Gilded Anvil (Blacksmith)
- Harey showed his **pistol and ammunition** to [[Master Smith Torvek Ironvein|Torvek]]
- Torvek examined the weapon carefully, identified the cartridge components
- **He can make bullets (75 gold per bundle of 20)** but needs the party to source **black powder** — too dangerous near the forges
- Suggested checking [[The Hargrove Brothers|Hargrove]] or the **caravan market** for powder — it comes up from the south with war supply convoys
- Galaric admired the **aethersteel longsword** locked in runed glass — Investigation 23 revealed heavy magical glyphs/protections
- Torvek confirmed aethersteel properties: **unbreakable edge, ignores resistances, bonds to its wielder, gains a unique property** when forged
- The sword requires **8-10 pounds** of aethersteel — astronomically expensive

### 4. Galaric's Private Visit (The Hovel)
- Galaric slipped away to visit **Ilira** and her sick mother in the shantytown
- Ilira confirmed [[Sister Amara Sol|Sister Sol's]] visits have been helpful — *"That lady she sent was very lovely"*
- Galaric left rations, puzzle trinkets for Ilira, and **30 gold** hidden in the house as emergency funds
- He spent quality time describing the Umberwilds' wonders (nothing scary) and explaining he may be away for extended periods
- **Took precautions leaving** — checked for tails, saw nothing unusual
- Stopped at the clinic on the way back for supplies and to tend to wounded

### 5. Evening at The Exile's Pit
- The party attended the **pit fights** at the [[Exile's Pit]]
- **Venue:** Oval pit 60×40 ft, 10 ft deep, sand floor with dark stains, iron cages along the far wall
- **Caged creatures spotted:** Iridescent multi-eyed cats, a floating jelly, four-armed creatures
- **Entry fee:** 5 gold to watch; betting available
- **Fight watched:** Veteran fighter vs. a **displacer beast** (2:1 odds favoring the beast)
  - The fighter started strong (froze the beast somehow), took heavy hits mid-fight, but won in the end with a broken sword improvised as a stabbing weapon
  - **Players rolled dice that narratively affected the fight** — fun meta mechanic
- **Betting results:** Harey bet 25 gold on the man → won **75 gold** (2:1 + original); Galaric bet 25 gold → won **75 gold**; Wyatt did not bet
- Wyatt passively scanned for his quarry — **did not spot him**

### 6. Evening Wind-Down at The Broken Span
- Wyatt asked [[Ma Jessa Carver|Ma Jessa]] about his quarry — she gave a cagey *"maybe"* but refused to share guest information (*"That's not good for business"* — reputational risk)
- Party agreed on the cover story for the map: **"party trick, draws the same thing over and over, boring trinket"**
- **Level-up mechanic introduced:** Players can level to 4 at any narratively appropriate moment — must describe *how* and *why* it happens in-story
- **Harey's midnight celebration:** Found "Uncle Pappy's Lucky Rabbit Foot" in his backpack — ran through the inn screaming with joy at 2 AM, banging on doors. Earned threats from other patrons. Wyatt also has a rabbit's foot. *(Harey took the Lucky feat)*
- Galaric continued staying at the hovel, not the inn — stopped at the clinic each evening

### 7. Morning — Collecting Payment from Thorne
- Party collected payment for the patrol rescue mission: **500 gold total** (300 base + 200 survivor bonus)
- Split 3 ways = ~167 gold each
- Thorne was surprised at their casual attitude about entering the Maw
- She admitted she's **never entered the Maw herself** — *"I didn't really want to go. I think it just didn't want me because I didn't want to be there."*
- Galaric left a **sealed letter** with Thorne for [[Sister Amara Sol|Sister Sol]] in case he doesn't return

### 8. Crossing the Anchor Span & Entering the Maw
- Third crossing for Harey/Galaric, fourth for Wyatt — still unnerving
- Sound cuts off completely ~3 feet into the jungle — total silence except heartbeat and **faint giggling**
- **The Maw entrance:** 20-foot tall arch of rippling violet shimmer, framed by twisted thorns, light bending wrong, shadows stretching toward it on their own
- Compulsion to **raise right hand** — all three gave in
- Violet swallowed them — warm, one heartbeat of nothing, then smell of old library

### 9. Vane's Audience (The White Void)
- Materialized in a **cold white void** with mismatched chairs around a heavy wooden table (grain shifts when you look away)
- Met **[[Prime Alrec Vane]]** in person:
  - Elven, ageless (could be 30 or 3,000)
  - Hair: violet-gold, shifts in tone
  - Eyes: one deep violet (matching the Maw entrance), one liquid gold
  - Robes with constellations that match nothing known
  - Voice arrives "behind your eyes" — not loud, but inescapable
  - Terrifyingly calm
- **His question:** *"Why are you here?"*
  - Galaric: "Curiosity"
  - Wyatt: "Need — information and power"
  - Harey: "Had no intention, but curiosity overcame me"
- Vane accepted them: *"You may enter my carnival. Survive, and you pass."*
- Chairs tilted back, world shifted — suddenly standing before a **full carnival** under a nighttime sky

### 10. The Carnival of Trials

#### Trial 1: Hall of Mirrors
- Hundreds of mirrors, reflections half-second delayed, one tilts its head when you didn't, another smiles too wide
- Voice: *"Only one of us walks out."*
- **Mechanic:** Acrobatics/Investigation checks, 3 phases
  - Phase 1 (Acrobatics): 16, 17, 19 — passed
  - Phase 2 (Investigation, mist obscured): 17, 21, 18 (Harey used 5 luck points) — passed
  - Phase 3 (Straight D20): 18, 9, 18 — Harey wobbled but the group steadied him
- **Reward:** Each received a **Mirror Shard** — detect illusion once while in the Maw

#### Trial 2: Whack-a-Mole (Imp Heads)
- Insulting imp heads pop up from holes, party given oversized mallets
- **Mechanic:** Attack rolls, multiple rounds
- Rounds went: success, success, success, success (easy run) → then imps spat at them (AC check, all dodged) → continued attacking
- One failed round: **Harey took 6 psychic damage** from a head that got through
- **Reward:** **30 gold** each

#### Trial 3: Gravity Ring Toss
- Purple void, rings of pale stone orbiting a gravity well, obsidian balls to throw through rings
- **Mechanic:** Athletics checks (strength-based throwing)
- Galaric tried to cheat with **Mage Hand** — ball hit the gravity barrier and missed (Mage Hand can't compensate for the physics)
- Harey: Lucky feat → rolled 16/17 → success
- Galaric: 11 base + 5 luck points = 15 → success (barely!)
- Wyatt: failed → **obsidian ball smacked him in the face for 6 bludgeoning damage**
- **Reward:** Harey and Galaric each received a **Feather** (one-use Feather Fall while in Maw); Wyatt got a face bruise

#### Trial 4: Fortune Teller's Tent
- Spectral crone with milky eyes, breathing crystal ball showing personal histories
- Ball showed each player moments from their past — things they haven't told anyone
- **Mechanic:** Insight or Persuasion to discern true fate
  - Rolls: 15, 17, 26 — all succeeded
- Each saw the **silver lining** of a dark past event or the celebration of a good one — personal character moments
- **Reward:** **Tarot Card (Death)** — extra death save roll if needed (one use, while in Maw)

#### Trial 5: Laughing Winds Corridor
- Howling wind with neon colors, razor confetti, explosive orbs
- **Mechanic:** Dexterity saving throws, multiple rounds
  - Round 1: 15, nat 20, 15 — all passed
  - Round 2: 22, 18, 14 — Wyatt took **6 bludgeoning**
  - Round 3: 15 (with luck), 20, 21 — Galaric barely made it
  - Round 4: 17, 15, 6 bludgeoning → Galaric used **Accelerate/Decelerate** to halve damage to 3
- **Reward:** **Wind Whistle** — cast Gust of Wind once while in Maw

### 11. The Big Top — Final Trial (Combat)

**Initiative:** Wyatt 24, Harey 16, Galaric 14

**Enemies: "The Unraveled"**
- 1 **Ringmaster** — 8 ft tall, bulging independently-rotating eyes, top hat, whip that scars the air, grin splitting face in half
- 4 **Imp Clowns** — painted-face imps in clown outfits, buzzing wings, juggling hissing pies

**Round 1:**
- Wyatt: Bonus action dash → Rapier + Sneak Attack (12 damage), Vengeful Blade placed, retreated 20 ft
- Harey: Evil Eye on Ringmaster, crossbow missed
- Galaric: Shortbow 8 piercing + Finger Guns (Eldritch Blast reflavor) 7 force damage on Ringmaster

**Round 2 (Enemies):**
- Ringmaster used **eye ray** — Wyatt failed CON save (11) → **PARALYZED**
- Imps swarmed positions

**Round 3:**
- Wyatt: Failed CON save to break paralysis → **still paralyzed**, then took 4 psychic damage from another ability
- Harey: Switched Evil Eye, attacked imp — 11 missed, 24 hit for 14 damage (imp badly hurt)
- Galaric: **Vampiric Bite** on imp (15 hits, 9 damage — first time revealing fangs!), Finger Guns on Ringmaster (15 hits, 9 force) — **Ringmaster went down!**

**Round 4:**
- Wyatt: Failed ANOTHER CON save → **went down** (0 HP from accumulated damage + auto-crit from paralysis)
- Imps attacked: one missed Galaric, two hit paralyzed Wyatt for **12 damage total** (2 failed death saves)
- Death save: Wyatt rolled 13 → **stabilized** (used the Death tarot card as insurance)

**Round 5:**
- Harey: Missed first dagger, **Natural 20** on second → 32 damage → killed imp (*"How do you want to do this?"* — death-from-above double-handed plunge)
- Galaric: Killed another imp (shortsword 6 + dagger 7 + sliding Finger Guns 11 force on the Ringmaster — **double kill** as he slid across sawdust)

**Round 6:**
- Last imp missed everyone
- Galaric: Short sword + dagger = 16 slashing/piercing (didn't finish it)
- Imp stung Galaric: 6 piercing + 7 poison damage (Galaric's Evil Eye forced reroll but imp rolled 17 again)
- Wyatt: Death save 12 → **stabilized** (3 for 3 on death saves)
- Harey: Sneak attack from behind → finished the last imp

**Post-Combat:**
- Galaric used **Healer's Kit** (Surgeon feature) on Wyatt — expended hit die to restore HP
- Wyatt had visions of **[[Iron Jack]]** during his death saves — the night everything went wrong, same feeling of despair, then pre-dawn light returning

### 12. The Mark of Vane

After combat, [[Prime Alrec Vane|Vane's]] hologram appeared over the sawdust ring:
- *"Well forged."*
- **Branded their right palms** with a white-hot sigil — intricate, personal, pulsing violet at their heartbeat rhythm
- *"You are Marked. You may return. You may delve deeper."*
- His gold eye appraised each of them with "dead rock seriousness"

**The Warning — Spoiler Curse:**
- For one blink, Vane's illusion flickered to reveal his **true form** — too many angles, eyes darting like stars. Then instantly back to the warm elven smile.
- *"Spoilers ruin everything, don't you think?"*
- Sigils flared hot — words rose in their throats, turned to **glass** (crystalline, jagged, scraping), then dissolved
- **The rule:** Among fellow Marked, speak freely (*"Palm to palm, the old way"*). To the unmarked — the glass was just a whisper. *"Imagine a shout."*
- *"The world beyond my gate grows restless. I require steady hands. Do not disappoint me."*
- The carnival dissolved. Tent poles became trees. Sawdust became moss.

### 13. Return to Umbergate

- Emerged at sunset, 100 yards from the Anchor Span
- Party discussed what they experienced — confirmed they can talk freely among themselves as Marked
- Mentioned wanting to find the **hooded Marked man** at [[The Broken Span Inn]] for information (the one with the glowing palm from Session 1)
- As they crossed the Span, word traveled fast — **a small crowd gathered** at the gatehouse
- Some cheered, some stared at their palms with **naked hunger**, an old woman clutched prayer beads and turned away
- [[Captain Renza Thorne|Captain Thorne]] pushed through, saw their palms: *"Well, marked already. You three don't waste time, do you? What'd you see out there?"*
- **Session ended on that cliffhanger**

## New Lore & World-Building

- **Iron Dominion** — enemy nation to the east, active war, one season from the Fracture. Umbergate's salt and aethersteel feed the war effort
- **Aethersteel properties** — unbreakable edge, ignores resistances, bonds to wielder gaining a unique property, astronomically valuable
- **Black powder** — available via southern caravans, needed for Harey's pistol ammunition
- **Pit fighting culture** — sanctioned entertainment, doesn't violate protection clause, potentially lethal for fighters
- **The Marked** — Vane's sigil on the right palm, grants return access to the Maw, comes with a **spoiler curse** (cannot reveal Maw details to the unmarked)
- **Vane's true form** — briefly glimpsed: too many angles, eyes like darting stars, distinctly *not* the elven facade

---

## Character Development

- **Wyatt:** Refuses to share details about his quarry or who he's hunting. Went down in combat — death save visions of [[Iron Jack]] and the night everything changed. Dawn = hope motif.
- **Galaric:** Deeply protective of Ilira and her mother — left gold, supplies, and instructions. **Revealed his vampiric bite for the first time in combat** (bit an imp's neck). The other PCs reacted with shock. Spending nights at the hovel, not the inn.
- **Harey:** Took the **Lucky feat** (narratively: Uncle Pappy's rabbit foot found in backpack). Chaotic energy — midnight celebration waking the whole inn, enthusiastic betting. Burning through luck points aggressively.

---

## Open Threads & Hooks

1. **The Map Fallout** — Wardens saw the map. By now, the market knows. Omar will know by tomorrow. The party is "the most interesting people in Umbergate." *(See [[Session 04 – The Map Fallout]] brainstorm)*
2. **Wyatt's Quarry** — Still hasn't found the man he's tracking. Ma Jessa gave a "maybe." Thorne confirmed the target is likely still in town under protection.
3. **Thorne's Question** — Session ended with her asking what they saw. They're Marked now — they *can't* tell her specifics (spoiler curse). How do they navigate this?
4. **The Hooded Marked Man** — The brooding figure at [[The Broken Span Inn]] with the glowing palm. Party wants to find him now that they're fellow Marked and can speak freely palm-to-palm.
5. **Galaric's Secret** — Vampiric bite revealed in combat. Harey and Wyatt saw it. How do they react going forward?
6. **Black Powder Supply Chain** — Harey needs powder for bullets. Caravans from the south. Hargrove looking out for it.
7. **Aethersteel Sword** — Torvek's masterwork locked behind runed glass at [[The Gilded Anvil]]. Party very interested.
8. **Level 4 Timing** — All three are eligible. Must be narratively justified. Harey already took Lucky feat via rabbit foot story.
9. **Vane's Warning** — *"The world beyond my gate grows restless. I require steady hands."* What does he need them for?
10. **Payment for Patrol** — 500 gold collected. No outstanding debts with Thorne.
11. **The Compass** — Still unrevealed to Thorne. What does it do?

---

## DM Notes

- **Pit Fight Mechanic** — Players rolled escalating dice (D20 → D12 → D10 → D8 → D6 → D4) to narratively influence the fight. Great engagement tool — reuse for future pit nights.
- **Carnival pacing** was excellent — 5 trials + boss fight in one session with town RP on top.
- **Luck points:** Harey burned through 21 of 23 luck points this session. He's at 2 remaining.
- **Narrative leveling** is now in play — players choose when to level up with a story beat.
- **Spoiler curse** is a brilliant narrative lock — players literally can't spoil the Maw to NPCs. Forces creative communication with Thorne et al.
