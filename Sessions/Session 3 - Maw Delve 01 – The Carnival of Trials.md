# Maw Delve 01: The Carnival of Trials – DM Session Guide

**Tags:** #session/maw #delve-1 #vane #carnival

**Session Goal:** Players enter the Maw for the first time, face Vane's composed evaluation, survive 5 carnival "tests" of worthiness, triumph in the Big Top finale. Exit as Marked delvers with aethersteel loot. Hook: Prove agency, feel the Wilds' chaos, glimpse Vane's "restless" problem.  
**Level:** 1-3 (scale CRs for party size). **Time:** 3-4 hours. **Pacing:** 20 min intro/Vane → 15-20 min per attraction → 30 min Big Top → 20 min exit/hooks.  
**Prep:** Print stat blocks (end). Review backstories for Vane ties. Contingencies for TPK/retreat (Vane ejects safely). **Rewards:** Mark (sigil: +1 attunement slot, detect Wilds magic 60ft), 200gp aethersteel scrap/ingot.

**Atmosphere Tips:** Wilds colors pulse vivid—neon vines twist mid-air, gravity hiccups (loose pebbles float). Air hums ozone-sweet, distant giggles echo. Vane's domain: Endless white void → candy-striped tents under starry chaos sky. Narrate surges (roll [[Wild Magic Surge Table]] if spells fizzle/backfire). Agency: Let choices shape tests (e.g., help NPC → boon).

## Scene 1: Approach to the Maw (10 min – Immersion Hook)
**Trigger:** PCs trek 1k yards past Span (Survival DC 12 or get lost in surges: random [[Wilds Encounters]]).  

> [!read]  
> The Wilds assault your senses: trees bloom with glowing fruit that whispers temptations, rivers flow uphill in rainbow arcs. Ahead, the Maw looms—a 20-ft arch of rippling violet heat-shimmer, framed by thorned candy canes that bleed syrup. Ozone thickens; a faint giggle rides the wind. Raise your right hands...

**Mechanics:** All raise hands (group action). Vane selects (assume yes; if 1 chaotic PC dominates, test Intimidation/Persuasion DC 15 or eject 1). Sigil burns faintly (harmless). Gentle pull → Scene 2.

**Player Agency:** Describe hands/poses → Vane comments later ("Bold gestures, bold hearts").

## Scene 2: Vane's Audience (15 min – RP Evaluation)
> [!read]  
> Violet parts like velvet. Cool white void solidifies: mismatched chairs circle a plain table. Opposite sits **[[NPCs/Maw/Prime Alrec Vane]]**—elfin, ageless, violet-gold hair shimmering, mismatched eyes (violet/gold) calm. Robes shift with faint stars. Voice smooth, amused undertone:  
> "Welcome. I am Alrec Vane. Entry is earned. Why are you here? What do you seek beyond my gate? Speak plainly."

**Tone:** Composed judge—leans in, steeples fingers. Soft chuckle at wit; eyes flicker sigils on "Wilds." Probes backstories (1 question/PC, 30 sec each).  

**Mechanics:** Pure RP. Reward depth:  

| Response Quality | Outcome |
|------------------|---------|
| Bland ("gold") | Sigh: "Many seek. Prove in trials." (No boon) |
| Honest/Tied to Hook | Nod: "Useful." (Inspiration 1 PC) |
| Creative/Agency | Smile: "You understand." (Temp 1d10 HP/party) |

**Hints:** "The world beyond grows restless... I require steady hands." (Seepage tease.)  

**Contingencies:**  
- Probe Vane: "Curiosity serves. Patience masters." (Deflect.)  
- Combat? Impossible—he vanishes, retry tomorrow.  
- Fail all? Eject to Wilds edge (exhausted, no Mark).  

**Transition:** "Acceptable. Enter the Carnival. Survive... you pass." Chairs tilt; dissolve to tents.

## Scenes 3-7: Carnival Attractions (75 min – 5 Tests)
Candy-striped big top looms central; 5 tents ring it. Giggling carnie sprites (invisible) heckle: "Step right up, fresh meat!" Each: Read-aloud → Challenge (combat/puzzle/skill) → Reward chest (unlock w/ success). Fail: Surge (Wild Magic) + retry or skip (penalty). Order flexible—agency!

### Attraction 1: Mirror Maze (Illusions/Agility)
> [!read]  
> Mirrors warp endlessly—your reflections leer, multiply. Doppelganger-you snarls: "Only one walks out."  

**Challenge:** Navigate (group Acrobatics/Investigation DC 13, 3 successes before 3 fails). On fail: Mirror twin attacks (2x Spectator stats, CR 3 total).  
**Rewards:** Mirror shard (detect illusion 1/day), 25gp aether dust.

### Attraction 2: Whack-a-Maw (Combat Reflexes)
> [!read]  
> Mallets glow; aberration heads (eyes/tentacles) pop from holes, gibbering. "Whack 'em before they whack you!"  

**Challenge:** Initiative! 8 rounds: Whack (Attack DC 12) or heads swarm (1d6 psychic dmg/round). 6+ kills = win.  
**Rewards:** Mallet (club, +1d4 force), 30gp scrap.

### Attraction 3: Ring of Gravity (Strength/Puzzle)
> [!read]  
> Floating rings orbit a gravity well—toss balls through or get crushed. Balls whisper failures.  

**Challenge:** Athletics DC 14 x3 (STR contest vs. well, AC 15). Aid: Help action halves DC. Fail round: 2d6 bludgeoning pull.  
**Rewards:** Gravity stone (feather fall 1/day), 40gp ingot sliver.

### Attraction 4: Fortune Teller's Tent (Insight/RP)
> [!read]  
> Crystal ball swirls; spectral hag cackles: "See your fate... or twist it?" Visions of backstories twist wrong.  

**Challenge:** Insight/Persuasion DC 15 to discern true fate (1 lie/option). Wrong choice: Curse (disadv. next test).  
**Rewards:** Fate tarot (reroll 1 death save/day), 35gp dust.

### Attraction 5: Dodge the Laughing Winds (Dex/Survival)
> [!read]  
> Winds howl laughter, hurling candy bombs that explode confetti-blades. "Dance or dissolve!"  

**Challenge:** Dodge 5 blasts (Dex save DC 13/round). Half speed in wind.  
**Rewards:** Wind whistle (gust of wind 1/day), 50gp scrap.

**Pacing Tip:** 10-15 min each. Mid-way: Sprite tally: "Halfway, heroes! Big Top awaits!"

## Scene 8: Big Top Finale (30 min – Boss Fight)
> [!read]  
> Central tent bursts open: Sawdust ring under chaotic stars. Vane's voice booms: "Final trial—face the Unraveled!" Clowns (aberrant) cartwheel in, ringmaster cracks whip.  

**Boss:** **Ringmaster Grulk** (CR 4: Spectator + Ringmaster hat: whip lash 3d6 + fear gaze). **Adds:** 4 Clown Imps (Imp stats, pie bombs: 2d6 poison gas).  
**Tactics:** Grulk teleports mirrors for cover; imps flank. Phase 2 (50% HP): Tent surges—falling stars (DC 14 Dex, 4d6 fire).  
**Loot:** Grulk's whip (+1, frighten DC 13), 100gp aether ingot.

**Victory:** Vane appears (hologram): "Well forged. You are Marked." Palms glow (sigil). "Return when ready... the restless stir." Fade to Wilds edge.

---

## Scene 9: Exit & Town Hooks (20 min – Debrief)
> [!read]  
> Maw spits you 100yds west of Span—sunset paints Wilds vivid. Marked palms throb warm. Wardens spot you ([[NPCs/Town/Captain Renza Thorne]]: "Marked already? Report.").  

**Rewards Total:** Sigil + 200gp aether (craft/attune), 800 XP/party.  

**Hooks (Agency):**  
- Thorne: "Details—wardens tithe 10% steel." (Favor/quest.)  
- Marked cheer in town: Free inn night, [[Locations/Town/The Laughing Maw]] entry.  
- Surge aftermath: Wildling tracks → optional combat.  
- Personal: Backstory NPC reacts ("Your palm... like my lost kin!").

**Contingencies:**  
- TPK/Wipe: Vane revives outside, "Unworthy... yet." (No Mark, exhaustion.)  
- Retreat Mid: Eject to Wilds (lost gear, surge table).  
- Speed Run: Skip weak attractions? Vane: "Clever. But depth matters." (Half rewards.)  

**Session Close:** "What now?" Let agency drive—Nyx rumors swell ("Marked bring steel... and nightmares."). Award Inspiration for RP.  

> [!info] Stat Blocks
> **Clown Imp:** Imp (MM) + Poison Gas Pie: 15ft cone, DC 12 Con 2d6 poison.  
> **Ringmaster Grulk:** Spectator (MM) + Whip: +6 1d4+4 slash + frighten (DC 13 Wis).  

**Next Session Tease:** Nyx camp clues from loot; Thorne quest; Wilds seepage worsens (town rumors update).
