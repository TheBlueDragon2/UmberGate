# Maw Delve 01: The Carnival of Trials – DM Session Guide

**Tags:** #session/maw #delve-1 #vane #carnival

**Session Goal:** Players enter the Maw for the first time, face Vane's composed evaluation, survive 5 carnival "tests" of worthiness, triumph in the Big Top finale. Exit as Marked delvers with aethersteel loot. Hook: Prove agency, feel the Wilds' chaos, glimpse Vane's "restless" problem.  
**Level:** 1-3 (scale CRs for party size). **Time:** 3-4 hours. **Pacing:** 20 min intro/Vane → 15-20 min per attraction → 30 min Big Top → 20 min exit/hooks.  
**Prep:** Print stat blocks (end). Review backstories for Vane ties. Contingencies for TPK/retreat (Vane ejects safely). **Rewards:** Mark (sigil: +1 attunement slot, detect Wilds magic 60ft), 200gp aethersteel scrap/ingot.

**Atmosphere Tips:** Wilds colors pulse vivid—neon vines twist mid-air, gravity hiccups (loose pebbles float). Air hums ozone-sweet, distant giggles echo. Vane's domain: Endless white void → candy-striped tents under starry chaos sky. Narrate surges (roll [[Wild Magic Surge Table]] if spells fizzle/backfire). Agency: Let choices shape tests (e.g., help NPC → boon).

## Scene 1: Approach to the Maw (10 min – Immersion Hook)
**Trigger:** PCs trek 1k yards past Span (Survival DC 12 or get lost in surges: random [[Wilds Encounters]]).  

> [!read]  
> The Wilds thicken as you press west. Trees knot overhead into a cathedral of pulsing violet and electric green, branches reaching for each other like desperate hands. The air turns syrup-thick — sweet ozone laced with something copper and alive. Your boots sink into moss that breathes warmth back through the leather.
> 
> Then the sound dies.
> 
> Not fades — *dies*. Birdsong, wind, your own footsteps — swallowed. In the silence, you hear only your heartbeat and a faint, high giggle that comes from everywhere and nowhere.
> 
> And there it is. A twenty-foot arch of rippling violet shimmer, heat-haze without heat, framed by twisted growths like thorned candy canes weeping dark syrup into the moss. The air before it *bends* — light curving wrong, your shadows stretching toward it without your permission.
> 
> Something in you wants to step forward. Something else screams to run.
> 
> Raise your right hands.

**Mechanics:** All raise hands (group action). Vane selects (assume yes; if 1 chaotic PC dominates, test Intimidation/Persuasion DC 15 or eject 1). Sigil burns faintly (harmless). Gentle pull → Scene 2.

**Player Agency:** Describe hands/poses → Vane comments later ("Bold gestures, bold hearts").

## Scene 2: Vane's Audience (15 min – RP Evaluation)
> [!read]  
> The violet swallows you like warm water.
> 
> For one heartbeat — nothing. No floor, no sky, no self. Just the faint smell of old libraries and lightning.
> 
> Then the world *decides* to exist. A cool white void crystallizes around you — not walls, not fog, just... absence with edges. Mismatched chairs sit in a loose circle around a plain wooden table that shouldn't feel this heavy, this *important*. The grain in the wood shifts when you're not looking directly at it.
> 
> Sitting opposite, legs crossed, fingers steepled, is a figure who makes your eyes disagree with your brain. Elfin and ageless — could be thirty, could be three thousand. Hair like spun violet-gold that shimmers without any light source. One eye the deep violet of the Maw's gate. The other liquid gold, warm and amused and absolutely *terrifying* in its calm.
> 
> His robes shift with constellations that don't match any sky you've ever seen. He hasn't blinked. You're not sure he needs to.
> 
> When he speaks, the voice isn't loud. It doesn't need to be. Every syllable arrives directly behind your eyes.
> 
> "Welcome. I am Alrec Vane. Entry is earned."
> 
> A pause. The gold eye tracks across each of you like a jeweler appraising stones.
> 
> "Why are you here? What do you seek beyond my gate? Speak plainly."

**Tone:** Composed judge—leans in, steeples fingers. Soft chuckle at wit; eyes flicker sigils on "Wilds." Probes backstories (1 question/PC, 30 sec each).  

**Mechanics:** Pure RP. Reward depth:  

| Response Quality | Outcome |
|------------------|---------|
| Bland ("gold") | Sigh: "Many seek. Prove in trials." (No boon) |
| Honest/Tied to Hook | Nod: "Useful." (Inspiration 1 PC) |
| Creative/Agency | Smile: "You understand." (Temp 1d10 HP/party) |

**Hints:** "The world beyond grows restless... I require steady hands." (Seepage tease.)  

**Contingencies:**  
- Probe Vane: "Curiosity serves. Patience masters." (Deflect.)  
- Combat? Impossible—he vanishes, retry tomorrow.  
- Fail all? Eject to Wilds edge (exhausted, no Mark).  

**Transition:** "Acceptable. Enter the Carnival. Survive... you pass." Chairs tilt; dissolve to tents.

## Scenes 3-7: Carnival Attractions (75 min – 5 Tests)
Candy-striped big top looms central; 5 tents ring it. Giggling carnie sprites (invisible) heckle: "Step right up, fresh meat!" Each: Read-aloud → Challenge (combat/puzzle/skill) → Reward chest (unlock w/ success). Fail: Surge (Wild Magic) + retry or skip (penalty). Order flexible—agency!

### Attraction 1: Mirror Maze (Illusions/Agility)
> [!read]  
> You step through the flap and the world fractures. Mirrors — hundreds of them — stretch in every direction, floor to ceiling, angled wrong, reflecting reflections of reflections into infinity. The glass is too clear. Too *eager*.
> 
> Your reflections stare back. But they're a half-second slow. One of them tilts its head when you didn't. Another smiles — teeth too wide, too sharp.
> 
> From deep in the maze, your own voice calls back to you: "Only one walks out."

**Challenge:** Navigate (group Acrobatics/Investigation DC 13, 3 successes before 3 fails). On fail: Mirror twin attacks (2x Spectator stats, CR 3 total).  
**Rewards:** Mirror shard (detect illusion 1/day), 25gp aether dust.

### Attraction 2: Whack-a-Maw (Combat Reflexes)
> [!read]  
> A ring of wooden pedestals surrounds a sand pit, each topped with a brass-rimmed hole just wide enough for something unpleasant. Oversized mallets lean against the posts, handles wrapped in cracked leather, heads glowing a faint sickly green.
> 
> A sprite's voice cackles from above: "Simple game, simple rules — smash what pops up before it pops *you*!"
> 
> The first hole *squelches*. A head erupts — not a head, an *approximation* of one. Too many eyes, arranged in a spiral. A tongue made of tentacles. It gibbers a sound that tastes like vinegar and screams.
> 
> More holes begin to twitch.

**Challenge:** Initiative! 8 rounds: Whack (Attack DC 12) or heads swarm (1d6 psychic dmg/round). 6+ kills = win.  
**Rewards:** Mallet (club, +1d4 force), 30gp scrap.

### Attraction 3: Ring of Gravity (Strength/Puzzle)
> [!read]  
> The tent opens into empty sky. No — not sky. A void, deep purple and starless, with rings of pale stone orbiting a point of crushing darkness at the center. The air hums with a low bass note you feel in your teeth.
> 
> Three balls of polished obsidian hover at chest height before you, each the size of a grapefruit, warm to the touch and faintly vibrating. They whisper when you hold them — fragments of failures. *"Couldn't throw far enough." "Gravity always wins." "Should have stayed home."*
> 
> The rings orbit lazily. The gravity well at the center pulls at your hair, your clothing, the air in your lungs.
> 
> Throw true — or get pulled in.

**Challenge:** Athletics DC 14 x3 (STR contest vs. well, AC 15). Aid: Help action halves DC. Fail round: 2d6 bludgeoning pull.  
**Rewards:** Gravity stone (feather fall 1/day), 40gp ingot sliver.

### Attraction 4: Fortune Teller's Tent (Insight/RP)
> [!read]  
> Incense so thick you can chew it. The tent is small — impossibly small from inside, barely room for the round table draped in moth-eaten velvet. Candles burn black flames that cast *white* shadows.
> 
> Behind the crystal ball sits a spectral crone who wasn't there a moment ago. Translucent skin stretched over too-sharp bones, milky eyes that see too much, a grin like a crack in old porcelain.
> 
> The crystal ball doesn't swirl — it *breathes*. Colors pulse inside like a heartbeat. And in those colors, you catch flashes — your faces. Your pasts. Things you haven't told anyone.
> 
> She cackles, dry as dead leaves on stone. "Oh, I *see* you, little sparks. Shall we look at what's coming? Or would you rather... *twist* it?"

**Challenge:** Insight/Persuasion DC 15 to discern true fate (1 lie/option). Wrong choice: Curse (disadv. next test).  
**Rewards:** Fate tarot (reroll 1 death save/day), 35gp dust.

### Attraction 5: Dodge the Laughing Winds (Dex/Survival)
> [!read]  
> The tent flap tears open on its own. Inside is a corridor of howling chaos — wind made visible, streaked with neon color, screaming with what sounds disturbingly like *laughter*. The walls ripple like cloth. The floor tilts five degrees to the left. Or is that you?
> 
> Candy-bright orbs the size of fists hurtle through the gale — beautiful, glittering, and exploding into razor-sharp confetti wherever they strike. A wooden post near the entrance has been shredded to splinters. Fresh splinters.
> 
> The sprite's voice, barely audible over the howl: "Dance or dissolve, darlings! No one walks through the Laughing Winds — you *survive* them!"

**Challenge:** Dodge 5 blasts (Dex save DC 13/round). Half speed in wind.  
**Rewards:** Wind whistle (gust of wind 1/day), 50gp scrap.

**Pacing Tip:** 10-15 min each. Mid-way: Sprite tally: "Halfway, heroes! Big Top awaits!"

---

## Scene 8: Big Top Finale (30 min – Boss Fight)
> [!read]  
> The central tent doesn't open — it *erupts*. Canvas walls blow outward like a held breath released, stakes ripping free, and you're standing in a sawdust ring under a sky that has no business existing. Stars wheel in spirals. Moons overlap in colors that hurt. The air smells of popcorn and ozone and something older than both.
> 
> Bleachers rise around you, packed with shadows that cheer and jeer and throw phantom peanuts. A spotlight — from *where?* — slams down on the center of the ring.
> 
> Vane's voice booms from the chaos sky, delighted as a child at a birthday party:
> 
> "Ladies, gentlemen, and things that defy classification — the FINAL TRIAL!"
> 
> A crack like a gunshot. A figure cartwheels into the spotlight — eight feet tall, bulging eyes rotating independently, wearing a top hat that defies geometry and cracking a whip that leaves glowing scars in the air. Its grin splits its face in half. Literally.
> 
> Behind it, four smaller shapes tumble in — painted faces frozen in permanent screams, tiny wings buzzing, juggling pies that hiss and smoke with green gas.
> 
> "Face... the UNRAVELED!"
> 
> The crowd roars. The whip cracks again. Initiative.

**Boss:** **Ringmaster Grulk** (CR 4: Spectator + Ringmaster hat: whip lash 3d6 + fear gaze). **Adds:** 4 Clown Imps (Imp stats, pie bombs: 2d6 poison gas).  
**Tactics:** Grulk teleports mirrors for cover; imps flank. Phase 2 (50% HP): Tent surges—falling stars (DC 14 Dex, 4d6 fire).  
**Loot:** Grulk's whip (+1, frighten DC 13), 100gp aether ingot.

## Scene 9: The Marking & Vane's Warning

> [!read]  
> Vane's hologram shimmers into existence above the sawdust — translucent, enormous, smiling with both eyes for the first time.
> 
> "Well forged."
> 
> He raises one hand. Your right palms ignite — not with pain, but with *recognition*. White-hot light traces a sigil into your skin, intricate as a fingerprint, personal as a name. It burns for three heartbeats, then settles to a warm violet glow that pulses with your pulse.
> 
> "You are Marked. You may return. You may delve deeper."
> 
> The gold eye finds each of you in turn. Then his voice shifts — still light, still amused, but beneath it, bedrock.
> 
> "One courtesy. The things you've seen here — the mirrors, the winds, the lovely Grulk — they are *mine*. My games. My surprises. My gifts to the next brave souls who raise their hands."
> 
> He leans forward. The hologram flickers — and for one frame, one *blink*, he is not elfin and ageless. He is something with too many angles and eyes like dying stars. Then he's back, smiling warmly.
> 
> "Spoilers ruin *everything*, don't you think?"
> 
> He touches his own palm. Your sigils flare — hot, sharp, just long enough to make you gasp. Words rise in your throat unbidden and turn to *glass*. You feel them — crystalline, jagged, scraping the inside of your mouth. Then they dissolve. The heat fades.
> 
> "The Mark knows what you know. It hears when you speak of my house. Among your fellow Marked — " he gestures casually, " — share freely. Palm to palm, the old way. The sigil permits it."
> 
> A pause. The smile widens.
> 
> "But to the unmarked? To the curious? To the *hungry*?"
> 
> He tilts his head like a child considering a butterfly's wings.
> 
> "Well. You felt the glass. That was a whisper. Imagine a *shout*."
> 
> He straightens. Light and warmth return to his voice like nothing happened.
> 
> "The world beyond my gate grows restless. I require steady hands. Do not disappoint me."
> 
> The carnival dissolves. Tent poles become trees. Sawdust becomes moss. You're standing a hundred yards west of the Anchorspan, sunset bleeding crimson and gold across the Fracture. Your palms throb warm.
> 
> You're back. You're different. And there are things you can never say.

**The Silence Rules (DM reference):**
- **Marked-to-Marked:** Free sharing via palm-clasp (60-sec telepathic flash, no save needed)
- **Marked-to-Unmarked:** Attempting to describe the Maw's interior triggers the geas — words turn to glass in throat (DC 15 Wis save or choke on blood-flecked crystal for 1 minute). Vague hints and allusions are safe; specific details trigger it
- **Vane knows:** The sigil is a two-way connection. Loose lips get remembered on the next delve (gravity reverses, memories become hostile NPCs, rooms "remember" you unkindly)
- **The glass demonstration was real** — players felt it. They don't need to test it to believe it

## Scene 10: Town Return & Hooks (20 min – Debrief)

> [!read]  
> Wardens on the Span spot you before you're halfway across. Word travels fast — by the time you reach the gatehouse, a small crowd has gathered. Some cheer. Some stare at your palms with naked hunger. An old woman clutches a prayer bead and turns away.
> 
> Captain Renza Thorne pushes through, arms crossed, eye-patch gleaming. She looks at your palms, then at your faces. Something between respect and worry settles behind her good eye.
> 
> "Marked already. You three don't waste time." A beat. "Report. What did you see out there?"

**Rewards Total:** Sigil + 200gp aether (craft/attune), 800 XP/party.  

**Hooks (Agency):**  
- Thorne: "Details—wardens tithe 10% steel." (Favor/quest.)  
- Marked cheer in town: Free inn night, [[Locations/Town/The Laughing Maw]] entry.  
- Surge aftermath: Wildling tracks → optional combat.  
- Personal: Backstory NPC reacts ("Your palm... like my lost kin!").

**Contingencies:**  
- TPK/Wipe: Vane revives outside, "Unworthy... yet." (No Mark, exhaustion.)  
- Retreat Mid: Eject to Wilds (lost gear, surge table).  
- Speed Run: Skip weak attractions? Vane: "Clever. But depth matters." (Half rewards.)  

**Session Close:** "What now?" Let agency drive—Nyx rumors swell ("Marked bring steel... and nightmares."). Award Inspiration for RP.  

> [!info] Stat Blocks
> **Clown Imp:** Imp (MM) + Poison Gas Pie: 15ft cone, DC 12 Con 2d6 poison.  
> **Ringmaster Grulk:** Spectator (MM) + Whip: +6 1d4+4 slash + frighten (DC 13 Wis).  

**Next Session Tease:** Nyx camp clues from loot; Thorne quest; Wilds seepage worsens (town rumors update).
