# Session 02 – Transcript Notes & Key Takeaways
**Tags:** #session #session-02 #transcript-notes

## What Actually Happened

### Travel into the Umberwilds
- Party crossed the Anchorspan and headed west following Thorne's directions to find the missing patrol
- 4-5 hours into the walk, overwhelmed by the neon ecosystem — even Harey (Feywild native) found the plants and sounds unfamiliar
- The Wilds don't transition naturally — biomes shift abruptly with obvious "lines," temperature and humidity changing suddenly. Players noticed this and found it unsettling

### Encounter 1: Spider Ambush (Luminous Path)
- Wyatt hit a spider web, triggering insect swarms and a canine-sized giant spider with spider children
- **Wyatt** got a nat 20 on his first attack — stabbed wildly through bugs while pulling webs off his face. Classic swashbuckler chaos
- **Galaric** used short sword + dagger combo effectively, tried finger guns (missed due to disadvantage in melee range)
- **Harey** used rabbit hop to reposition, cast blood bolt (necrotic), gained temp HP from vampiric bite ability
- Harey bounced into spider web on retreat — Dex save 19, barely avoided getting stuck
- Party won, used Galaric's healer's kit to patch Wyatt up
- **Key moment:** Party discussed crit rules above-table. Decided on standard double dice (not max die + roll). Ryan explained it applies to enemies too — "crits should feel like crits"

### Encounter 2: The Blight Tree
- Found massive tree with 3 cocoon-like "wounds" — 4 twig blights + 2 tree blights tending them
- Party spent 15 minutes observing from stealth before acting
- **Wyatt used Disguise Self** to look like a tree blight and infiltrated — massive creative play. Deception check 19. The blights mostly ignored him as a random unknown
- Wyatt got close enough to see: cocoons were thicker at the bottom, thinner at top. Faces visible inside — human, eyes closed, seemingly "asleep." Blights were packing MORE material on (not removing)
- Third cocoon had blood pooling — that one was already dead
- **Combat initiated** when Wyatt signaled (hand drop) — Galaric held action with crossbow, released on signal
- Wyatt rolled initiative 27 (+8 from Charisma mod as Swashbuckler)
- Tree blight tried to grapple Wyatt — he made both Strength saves (16 both times). Close calls
- Harey used Accelerate/Decelerate to stop needle blight projectiles mid-air — "Naruto style blood weaving" — the needles just fell. Whole table loved it
- Wyatt dashed in with Rakish Audacity for advantage, stabbed the big blight, used Fancy Footwork to retreat without opportunity attacks. Very swashbuckler

### The Rescue (and the Accident)
- **Cocoon 1:** Galaric freed successfully (nature check 18) — soldier alive but unconscious, warm
- **Cocoon 2:** Wyatt tried to free — rolled a 1 on nature check (effectively 0 with modifier). Cut the soldier's throat by accident while trying to free his head. The thin part of the cocoon gave way too easily
- **Cocoon 3:** Already dead (blood pooling confirmed)
- **Galaric blackmailed Wyatt** about the accidental kill — "Knowledge of murdering a guard, that's pretty hefty stuff"
- Party mutilated the body to make it look like blight damage (Performance check 17 — mostly convincing, one detail slightly off)
- **Pact made:** "What happens between the three of us stays between the three of us. We're rogues."
- Galaric struggled internally (visible to party) but agreed. Harey saw him struggling

### Esmerelda's Tree
- Found a door embedded in the tree trunk. Wyatt sent Sparrow (familiar) in first — smart
- Interior: books (handmade, nature-focused), potions, clean working area, no bed. More workshop than home
- **Esmerelda appeared** — initially looked like stereotypical hag (elongated nose, rough appearance)
- Saw their reactions and **shifted form right in front of them**: "Oh, I'm sorry. You would probably prefer this." Changed to pleasant-looking woman (~30s, attractive)
- Later shifted again to a mid-40s male form mid-conversation — completely unbothered by their reactions
- **Key behaviors:**
  - Utterly unconcerned about them. "If I wanted you dead, I would have already killed you"
  - Started bandaging Wyatt's wounds unprompted — competent but not a physician
  - Healed him ~12 HP through mundane medical care
  - Recognized details about each PC without being told (knew Wyatt was from the coast, etc.)
  - Knew about Dr. Nyx and the Maw
  - Said the Maw has been there "as long as the Umberwilds" — and some say the Umberwilds exist BECAUSE of the Maw
  - Told them entry to the Maw is guaranteed, but "there's more than one way to fail" — and it's not just alive vs. dead
  - Encouraged them to visit the Maw
  - Looked at their hands to check for the Mark — confirmed none of them had been
  - Offered to trade/help in the future
  - Said the blights "wandered in" — the patrol wasn't her doing
- **Harey's read:** High hag vibes confirmed. Shapeshifting, knowledge, power level all consistent. But behavior was different from Feywild hags — more pleasant, less territorial. Not evil incarnate, but definitely not good. "On the evil side of neutral"
- Harey knows hags move after being found. Door vanishing confirmed this — "they found my spot, I'm leaving"
- **Galaric was deeply suspicious** — edged toward the door the entire time, wanted to be closest to the exit
- Wyatt gave a courtly bow on exit — Esmerelda: "Oh, we don't do formalities out here"

### The Night Camp
- Found a clearing ~3 hours from Umbergate. Couldn't make it back before nightfall due to carrying unconscious soldier
- **Watch order:** Wyatt first, Harey second, Galaric third
- Wyatt summoned his tattoo companion during watch (dismissed before others saw). Companion was very interested in the hag encounter and curious about the Maw (tried to get in, couldn't)
- Galaric ritually cast Find Familiar — summoned a Fey owl for overnight watch, dismissed in morning
- **Galaric's watch:** Felt watched. Something else was out there — glints of eyes in the dark. Sparrow searched but couldn't identify it. Unsettling but no encounter
- Umberwilds at night: LOUD. Not quiet at all — insects, creatures, constant ambient noise. The danger signal is when sounds CHANGE, not when they're loud
- Galaric also secretly fed during his watch (vampiric nature — used the "warm meal available" i.e. the unconscious soldier)

### Return to Umbergate
- Made it back. Wardens waited at the Span edge — didn't come out to help, but reacted when they saw the patrol uniform
- **Thorne's reaction:**
  - Frustrated about losing two soldiers
  - Knew of Esmerelda immediately — "Esmerelda, great." Not surprised, just annoyed
  - Asked if Esmerelda had anything to do with the patrol being trapped — party said no
  - Pulled out a map to ask where the hut was located
- **THE MAP MOMENT:** Galaric pulled out the self-drawing map in front of Thorne without thinking
  - Thorne stopped everything. Session ended on that beat
  - Players realized they just revealed a powerful artifact to someone who would absolutely want it
  - The map had never been tested since they got it from Omar's box

## Player Personality Notes

### Wyatt (The Captain) — Player: ?
- Bold, impulsive, charges in. Classic swashbuckler energy
- Creative problem-solver (Disguise Self infiltration was brilliant)
- Makes mistakes under pressure (throat-slitting accident) but owns them
- Uses Sparrow tactically and for RP (scouting, distraction, emotional support)
- Has a secret companion he summons privately — doesn't fully trust the party yet
- "I'll always be the bait" — embraces the frontline role

### Galaric Morvson — Player: ?
- Cautious, observant, analytical. The planner
- Internally conflicted — vampire nature vs. morality (struggled with the silence pact)
- Feeds in secret (used unconscious soldier during watch)
- Blackmail play on Wyatt was *perfectly* in character for a phantom rogue
- Closest to the "responsible one" — patched people up, did the nature checks
- Most suspicious of Esmerelda — stayed near the exit the entire time

### Harey Quickstep — Player: ?
- Quick, reactive, confident in combat. Rabbit hop + crossbow combo is signature
- Hag knowledge is a real asset — recognized Esmerelda immediately
- Blood magic aesthetic (Naruto hand signs, blood bolts, accelerate/decelerate)
- Willing to follow the party's lead but speaks up when something seems wrong
- "I don't trust this son" — blunt about threats, even whispered
- Evil eye + sneak attack from hiding is devastating combo

## Table Culture Notes
- Players joke constantly — good chemistry, lots of banter
- Ryan lets them plan and debate before combat — the 15-minute observation before the blight fight was player-driven
- Crit rules decided collaboratively above-table (standard double dice)
- Players are learning their abilities session by session — some mid-combat lookups but getting faster
- One player had a character die in Session 0/1 of a previous campaign (sorcerer with wild magic table, painted mini and everything). Running joke about not painting minis
- Ryan is flexible with familiar mechanics and RP moments — lets players describe their crits and cool moments

## World State After Session 2
- 1 of 3 patrol members rescued (alive, unconscious)
- 2 patrol members dead (1 from blights/tree, 1 accidentally killed by Wyatt — covered up)
- Esmerelda encountered — she knows the party, has moved her tree
- Thorne knows they met Esmerelda — she's familiar with the hag and not happy about it
- Thorne has seen the self-drawing map — consequences TBD (this is Session 3-4 territory)
- Party has health potions from Esmerelda's tree (4 vials, red, standard healing)
- Galaric is secretly feeding on available sources — party doesn't know yet
- Wyatt's companion tried to enter the Maw and couldn't — the companion is very interested in it
