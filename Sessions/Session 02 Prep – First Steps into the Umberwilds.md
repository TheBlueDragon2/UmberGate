# Session 02 Prep – First Steps into the Umberwilds  
**Tags:** #session-prep #umberwilds #thornes-quest #nyx-hook  

## Goal  
Give the players their first real taste of the Wilds: wonder, danger, and unmistakable proof that “bad trees and bad sounds” means Dr. Nyx is close. Keep it short, vivid, and 100% choice-driven.

## Starting Point  
The party is 30–40 minutes west of the Anchorspan, slightly lost (low Survival rolls). They’re pushing through dense neon foliage toward where the scouts were meant to map beast trails.

## Read-Aloud Opener  
The canopy knits shut overhead like living stained glass—leaves in electric violet and searing crimson pulsing with slow heartbeats. The air turns thick and sweet, laced with ozone and overripe fruit. Your footsteps sometimes sink too deep, sometimes bounce as if the ground forgets its own weight. Birdsong has stopped. Instead, a low, wet scraping drifts on the wind… like fingernails dragging across wood.

## The Path (First Encounter Area)  
# Session 02 – Encounter 1: Luminous Path Ambush  
**Tags:** #session-prep #umberwilds #thornes-quest #encounter-1  

## Goal  
Breathe life into the Wilds' beauty-before-danger rhythm. Start serene, hit with insect swarms (easy chaos), escalate to spider hunter. Plants scout clues naturally. 30-45 min, high agency.

## Read-Aloud Opener (Entering the Path)  
A narrow stone path winds ahead, ancient slabs cracked and overgrown with luminous moss pulsing soft emerald and azure. Tall grasses and wildflowers glow—violets, pinks, blues blooming in perpetual twilight. Tiny blue orbs drift like fireflies, casting misty beams. Twisted vine sculptures rise silently. Night-blooming jasmine scents the air; footsteps release shimmering spores.

**Passive Perception 13+**: Faint blood flecks on path edge—scouts passed recently.

## The Ambush  

### Round 1: Insect Swarms (3 Swarms)  
**Description (first buzz)**  
The floating orbs wink out. A high-pitched whine swells—clouds of thumb-sized insects erupt from flowers, iridescent wings flashing neon. Needle proboscises gleam; they dive in frenzied hunger.

**Stats**  
- Use Swarm of Insects (MM p.338), reskin: Wilds Stirges.  
- Bonus: Blood-drain leaves faint crystal flecks (early Glass Plague hint).  
- **On hit**: "Victim's skin sparkles briefly with unnatural crystals."

### Round 2+: Giant Spider Hunter 
**Description (drop-in)**  
A shadow detaches from vines—massive spider (house-cat size) skitters down silk threads, fangs dripping venom. It's hunting the swarms, but eyes lock on you mid-leap.

**Stats**  
- Giant Spider 
- Bonus: Web strands pulse with wild magic—restrained targets take 1d4 force on escape.

## Key Clues (Search DC 13 or post-fight)  
1. **Scout Gear**: Span Warden insignia cloak  


## Rewards  
- Spider fangs (2d6 piercing darts, 3 uses).  

## The Twisted Grove (Second Encounter Area)  

### Atmosphere  
- Trunks veined with throbbing crimson light.  
- Long strips of bark peeled back and twitching like flayed skin.  
- Ground carpeted in soft violet moss that glows faintly underfoot.  
- Distant whispers inside the wood—syllables almost forming words.

### Discovery (Passive Perception 13 or active search)  
A small clearing holds three shredded Span Warden tents. Blood trails vanish into the trees. One halberd is buried blade-first in a trunk that has already begun growing around the steel. The whispering grows louder here, coming from the bark itself.

### The Threat – 4 Barkblights  
**Description (first sighting)**  
Four humanoid shapes uncoil from the trunks—bodies of twisted bark and strangling vine, needle-sharp thorns bristling. Amber knot-eyes glow with feral hunger. Branches drag across the moss with deliberate slowness.

**Stats**  
Use Needle Blight (MM p.32) or Tree Blight if you want bigger threat. Reskin:  
- When struck hard, they spurt glowing crimson sap (extra 1d6 acid on melee hits).  
- On death, they collapse into harmless piles of twitching bark.

### Key Clues (found during/after combat or by careful search)  
1. **Cocooned Scout** – One warden still breathing, pinned high in living vines. Early Glass Plague crystals glitter on arms and neck. Delirious mutters: “The Maker… promised perfection… metal that never breaks… no more pain…”  
2. Logbook -  log is in common and shows that the wardens have been tracked and monitored for the last two weeks.  
3. On body of Warden - Journal page (Nyx hook: "He replaces the weak parts?").  
4. Humanoid tracks are also around

### Player Choices & Contingencies  
- **Fight** – Straightforward but messy; blights try to grapple and drag PCs into trees (Strength save DC 13 or restrained).  
- **Sneak/Avoid** – Group Stealth DC 15; blights are territorial and won’t pursue far.  
- **Investigate Sounds** – Nature/Arcana DC 15: trees corrupted by wild magic bleed—early sign of Nyx’s experiments nearby.  
- **Rescue the Scout** – Medicine DC 13 to stabilize; success gives clearer Nyx intel, failure means he dies begging for “the Maker’s mercy.”

### Pacing Notes  
- Whole scene should take 45–75 minutes.  
### Rewards  
- 300 gp from Thorne for answers (plus 200 gp if they identify Nyx as cause).  

# Umberwilds Night Camp – Atmospheric Guide & d6 Encounters  
**Tags:** #session-prep #umberwilds #night-camp #thornes-quest  

## Setup Notes  
Party encumbered (cocooned scout: 150 lbs, exhaustion risk if rushed). Camp in a "safer" hollow (e.g., post-path). Watches: 3-4 rotations. Scout stable but moans faintly—Nyx whispers leak ("metal... perfect..."). Roll d6 once per watch or at midnight. Choices matter: noise attracts, fire/light draws predators, silence invites paranoia.

## Atmospheric Descriptions (Layer as Needed)  

### Dusk Transition (Read-Aloud)  
The sun bleeds crimson into the Fracture's depths, neon canopy igniting like fractured jewels—violets pulsing, crimsons throbbing. Auroral veils dance overhead, lime and cobalt weaving impossible patterns. Air thickens: humid ozone clings to skin, tingling like static before a storm. Phantom jasmine fades to coppery tang; every breath hums with unseen electricity.

### Full Night (Sensory Palette – Improv)  
- **See**: Trees glow inward, veins flickering like heartbeats. Floating motes wink in/out, casting long shadows that twist unnaturally. Distant silhouettes: too-many-limbed beasts silhouetted against horizon glow.  
- **Hear**: Wind giggles—childlike, mocking. Leaves rustle whispers ("join us... perfect..."). Far roars echo, cut short by wet snaps. Cocoon pulses with muffled groans.  
- **Smell**: Sweet rot (overripe fruit + decay), laced with storm-petals and blood-iron. Spores drift, leaving metallic aftertaste.  
- **Feel**: Gravity hiccups—steps lighten/heavy randomly. Skin prickles from wild magic static; hair rises. Ground warm, pulsing faintly like flesh. Humid air beads sweat that glows blue.  
- **Taste**: Air coats tongue coppery-sweet; water tastes of lightning.

### Dawn Tease (Read-Aloud End)  
Eastern grays creep in, Wilds dimming to bruised hues. Cocoon's glow fades; scout stirs weakly. Path home visible—exhaustion lingers, but survival earned.

## d6 Night Encounters (Roll Once/Watch or Midnight)  
| d6 | Encounter | Details & Choices |  
|----|-----------|-------------------|  
| **1** | **Stirge Swarm (Combat)** | 8-10 Wilds Stirges (MM p.284, +wild surge: drain leaves crystal flecks). Dive from canopy on firelight/noise. Winnable; loot: 2d4 crystal blood-vials (healing potion equiv.). |  
| **2** | **Vine Blight Ambush (Combat)** | 2 Vine Blights (MM p.32) + 4 Twig Blights. Entangle sleepers (Str DC 12). Escape: cut cocoon free (risk scout). Reward: aethersteel thorn (dagger +1 poison). |  
| **3** | **Neon Ape Pack (Combat)** | 3-4 Wilds Apes (reskin Dire Wolf, MM p.321; neon fur, magic claws). Curious → aggressive if food stolen. Flee viable (Athletics DC 14); parlay? (Animal Handling DC 15, offers fruit). |  
| **4** | **Whispering Fey (Non-Combat)** | Glowing sprite circle (reskin Pixie, no polymorph). Offers "dreams of metal perfection" (Insight DC 15: Nyx lure). Accept: temp HP + vision clue. Refuse: harmless giggles fade. |  
| **5** | **Surge Spring (Non-Combat)** | Glowing pool bubbles (Arcana/Nature DC 13: wild magic font). Bath: roll Wild Surge (PHB)—boon (invis 1hr) or bane (random polymorph). Scout improves slightly if dipped. |  
| **6** | **Nothing** | Uneventful. Paranoia builds (roleplay: eerie calm, scout mutters warnings). Gain short rest + inspiration for tension roleplay. |

## Contingencies  
- **Encumbered**: Disadv on Stealth/Init; drop cocoon = scout death (guilt hook).  
- **Agency Beats**: Fire? Draws 1-3. Silence? +2 to avoid. Magic? Surge risk.  
- **Pacing**: 20-40 min/encounter. End: Umbergate dawn arrival, Thorne payout + Amara heals scout (Nyx intel spills).  

Vivid, tense, player-shaped. They'll feel watched—Wilds alive. Run it! You've got this.
### Alive World Tick
