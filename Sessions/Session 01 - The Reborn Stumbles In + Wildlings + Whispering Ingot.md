**Tags:** #session #session-01 #town #hook #nyxrumor

## Read-Aloud Opener (Arrival at Anchorspan)

You stand at the eastern threshold of Umbergate, where the Caravan Market meets the Anchorspan Gatehouse. The Fracture yawns before you—a mile-deep chasm carved by ancient cataclysm, its sheer red-rock walls plunging into eternal shadow. Winds howl up from the abyss, carrying the sharp tang of ozone and salt, mingled with something feral: wild magic's electric bite and distant rot from impossible blooms.

Across the mile-long Anchorspan—ancient stonework impossibly defying gravity—lies the Umberwilds. Vivid colors riot beyond: neon trees pulsing like living flames, skies shimmering with auroral surges, faint silhouettes of twisted beasts flitting through haze. The bridge itself is desolate, scoured by gales, reserved only for the Marked fools who chase the Maw. Caravans rumble safely north-south along the inland Salt Road, far from this edge.

The air thrums with tension: merchants hawk glowing shards, hammers ring from the Gilded Anvil, and Vigil priests murmur prayers at the Wall of Remembrance. Then—a cry from the Gatehouse watch:

"A delver! Crossing the Span!"

A lone figure staggers into view halfway across: right arm fused with glittering crystal, veins spiderwebbing his flesh. He collapses, crawling the final yards before tumbling into the market dust, gasping:

"Nyx… he promised eternity…"

Shards explode outward in a razor spray. Chaos erupts.

**Player Agency Moment:** Roll Initiative (low stakes).  
- Aid the dying Reborn (DC 13 Medicine → whisper: “deep groves… eternity”)  
- Stop Tithe looters (4 thugs CR 1/8, 25 XP ea)  
- Calm Reborn pilgrims (Intimidation DC 12 vs zealot CR 2)  
- Watch idly — town eyes note cowards.

## Wildlings Alarm (Spotter Shout)
Gatehouse horn blares—three panicked blasts:  
“WILDLINGS ON THE SPAN! Six beasts—crossing the Anchorspan!”

(Beasts never dare it. Disaster.)

**Combat: Scaled for 3 Lvl 3 PCs (2024 Moderate-High: ~900 XP)**  
- 1 [[Creatures/Wildling Alpha]]  
- 5 [[Creatures/Wildling]]  
- Terrain: Stalls (half cover), salt dust (Difficult), updrafts (flyers adv).  
- Win: Thorne approves (favor), 2 aether shards (25gp ea).  

**Contingency:** Flee/loss? Beasts scatter rd 3 (guards clean up), -1 Warden rep.

## Post-Fight Hook: Whispering Ingot (Puzzle/Intrigue)
"Honest" Omar sidles up: "Heroes! Smuggler's hummer—crack it before Tithe. 50gp now, double solved." (Backstory ties: Debt pays partial; Plague? Vial stalls cryst.)

**Puzzle (1hr, Anvil optional):**  
1. **Runes (DC 13 Arcana):** Dwarvish: "Flesh yields to fire's kiss, but [?] endures." Whisper "aether" + heat. Fail: 1d6 fire (Dex DC 12 half).  
2. **Echo (Attune 1hr, DC 14 Insight group):** Tap rhythm. Fail: Vane giggle + 2 Echo Shades (Shadow CR 1/2 metallic; 100 XP). Success: Vial (Plague 1d4 days) + grove map tease.  

**Twists:** Reborn claims holy (Persuasion DC 14).  
**Rewards:** 100gp salt + [[Items/Whispering Ingot]].

## Pacing/End (2-3hr)  
- 20min immersion/chaos  
- 30min combat  
- 45min puzzle/explore (Omar/Market)  
- Tease: Thorne's "Hunt leavings" (Nyx hint).  
**World Lives:** Delay? Tithe/Reborn feud → next-day brawl.

**DM Notes:** Pure agency—ignore chaos? Factions clash visibly. Scale Alpha for caster-heavy.
