**Tags:** #session #session-01 #town #hook #nyxrumor

## Read-Aloud Opener (Arrival at Anchorspan)

You stand at the eastern threshold of Umbergate, where the Caravan Market meets the Anchorspan Gatehouse. The Fracture yawns before you—a mile-deep chasm carved by ancient cataclysm, its sheer red-rock walls plunging into eternal shadow. Winds howl up from the abyss, carrying the sharp tang of ozone and salt, mingled with something feral: wild magic's electric bite and distant smells from the Umberwild's impossible blooms.

As you stand near and look across the 300 yard-long Anchorspan—ancient stonework flat bridge, impossibly defying gravity—lies the Umberwilds. Vivid colors riot beyond: neon trees pulsing like living flames, skies shimmering with auroral surges, you're sure you saw a faint silhouette of twisted beast flitting through haze. The bridge itself is desolate, scoured by gales yet still in amazing shape for is age, reserved only for the Marked fools who chase the Maw and those that hear the call of the Wilds. Caravans rumble safely north-south along the inland Salt Road, staying away from the edge of the seemingly forever drop down the gorge.  Drivers try and hide their glances at the edge as they cannot see the bottom of what would be their fate if they got too close.

The air thrums with tension: merchants hawk glowing shards, hammers ring from the blacksmith, and a Vigil priest murmurs prayers at the Wall of Remembrance. Then—a cry from the Gatehouse watch:

"A delver! Crossing the Span!"

A lone figure staggers into view halfway across: right arm fused with glittering crystal, veins spiderwebbing his flesh. He collapses, crawling the final yards before tumbling into the market dust, gasping:

"Nyx… he promised eternity…"

Shards explode outward in a razor spray. Chaos erupts.

**Player Agency Moment – Chaos Erupts (Roll Initiative – low stakes, 2–3 rounds max)**

The Reborn’s body convulses once more and dozens of glass-sharp crystals spray in a 15-ft radius (anyone within 10 ft takes 1d4 piercing on a failed DC 13 Dex save, half on success – non-lethal, just panic fuel).

In the sudden uproar you hear:

- A hulking ogre in Iron Tithe colors (“Taxman” Korr’s collectors) roaring:  
  “Tithe’s ten percent on everything – including whatever’s left of this freak!”  
  Four Tithe thugs (CR 1/8) shove through the crowd, clubs out, already looting the dying man’s pack.

- From the Wall of Remembrance, three white-robed Reborn pilgrims drop to their knees, eyes shining with fanatic light:  
  “A martyr! The Maker’s gift made manifest! Do not touch the sacred flesh!”  
  One pilgrim (fanatic CR 2, aethersteel jaw glinting) begins a rising chant that’s half prayer, half threat.

- Captain Renza Thorne’s voice cracks like a whip from the Gatehouse balcony:  
  “Clear the market! Wardens – to arms! Anyone draws steel without my say loses the hand!”

- “Honest” Omar, already half-hidden behind a salt crate, hisses to the party:  
  “Oi, new blood! Help me keep my stall in one piece and there’s coin in it – or just stand there and get remembered as the ones who watched!”

Immediate options (players can mix & match):

1. **Aid the dying Reborn** (DC 13 Medicine or appropriate spell)  
   Success: he clutches a PC’s sleeve, blood bubbling: “Dr. Nyx… deep in the glowing groves… he can make you eternal… don’t let them burn me…” then dies.  
   Failure: crystals finish him; body shatters into harmless dust.

2. **Stop the Tithe looters** (combat or Intimidation/Deception)  
   Four Tithe thugs (25 XP each). If beaten or intimidated, the lead thug spits: “Taxman Korr’ll hear of this…”

3. **Calm or confront the Reborn pilgrims** (Persuasion, Intimidation, or Religion DC 12–15)  
   Success: they back down, weeping, and one slips the party a tiny aethersteel token “for honoring the path.”  
   Failure: the lead fanatic lunges with a hidden crystal dagger (single attack, then subdued by Wardens).

4. **Protect merchants / Omar’s stall** (Dex saves, Strength to hold canvas, or creative magic)  
   Omar pays 20 gp on the spot + owes a favor.

5. **Do nothing / try to slip away**  
   The town absolutely notices. Next time they enter the market, whispers follow: “Those are the ones who stood frozen when the martyr fell…”

Wardens (two veterans + Captain Thorne) arrive round 3 regardless and restore order, but what the party does in these first 60 seconds is what Umbergate remembers.

## Wildlings Alarm (Spotter Shout)
Gatehouse horn blares—three panicked blasts:  
“WILDLINGS ON THE SPAN! Six beasts—crossing the Anchorspan!”

(Beasts never dare it. Disaster.)

**Combat: Scaled for 3 Lvl 3 PCs (2024 Moderate-High: ~900 XP)**  
- 1 [[Creatures/Wildling Alpha]]  
- 5 [[Creatures/Wildling]]  
- Terrain: Stalls (half cover), salt dust (Difficult), updrafts (flyers adv).  
- Win: Thorne approves (favor), 2 aether shards (25gp ea).  

**Contingency:** Flee/loss? Beasts scatter rd 3 (guards clean up), -1 Warden rep.

## Post-Fight Hook: Whispering Ingot (Puzzle/Intrigue)
"Honest" Omar sidles up: "Heroes! Smuggler's hummer—crack it before Tithe. 50gp now, double solved." (Backstory ties: Debt pays partial; Plague? Vial stalls cryst.)

**Puzzle (1hr, Anvil optional):**  
1. **Runes (DC 13 Arcana):** Dwarvish: "Flesh yields to fire's kiss, but [?] endures." Whisper "aether" + heat. Fail: 1d6 fire (Dex DC 12 half).  
2. **Echo (Attune 1hr, DC 14 Insight group):** Tap rhythm. Fail: Vane giggle + 2 Echo Shades (Shadow CR 1/2 metallic; 100 XP). Success: Vial (Plague 1d4 days) + grove map tease.  

**Twists:** Reborn claims holy (Persuasion DC 14).  
**Rewards:** 100gp salt + [[Items/Whispering Ingot]].

## Pacing/End (2-3hr)  
- 20min immersion/chaos  
- 30min combat  
- 45min puzzle/explore (Omar/Market)  
- Tease: Thorne's "Hunt leavings" (Nyx hint).  
**World Lives:** Delay? Tithe/Reborn feud → next-day brawl.

**DM Notes:** Pure agency—ignore chaos? Factions clash visibly. Scale Alpha for caster-heavy.
