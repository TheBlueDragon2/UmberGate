# Session 01: The Reborn Stumbles In + Wildlings + Whispering Ingot

**Tags:** #session #session-01 #town #hook #nyxrumor

## Read-Aloud Opener (Arrival/Market Chaos)
The Anchorspan trembles under the weight of caravans and the occasional Wilds beast that slips the Wardens' watch. But today, it's a man who makes it shudder—a lone figure staggering from the haze-shrouded west, his right arm a grotesque fusion of flesh and glittering crystal, veins of glass spiderwebbing across his skin like frost on a windowpane. He collapses in the Caravan Market's dust, gasping, "Nyx... he promised eternity..." before his body seizes, crystals exploding outward in a spray of shards that slice tents and send merchants scrambling.

**Player Agency Moment:** Roll Initiative (low stakes). Options:
- Aid the dying Reborn (DC 13 Medicine: gains dying whisper, "Nyx... deep groves... eternity!")
- Stop looters (4 Tithe Thugs CR 1/8, 25 XP ea)
- Side with Reborn pilgrims (social: Intimidation DC 12 vs zealot fanatic CR 2)
- Flee/ignore: Factions resolve—Captain Thorne glares from the Gatehouse, rumors spread ("Cowards in the crowd").

## Wildlings Alarm (Spotter Shout)
As chaos peaks: Tower horn blares! "Wildlings inbound—six pack from the Span!"

**Combat: Scaled for 3 Lvl 3 PCs (2024 Moderate-High: ~900 XP)**
- 1 **Wildling Alpha** (link to stat block)
- 5 **Wildlings** (link to stat block)
- Terrain: Market stalls (half cover), salt dust (Difficult Terrain), updraft (flyers advantage).
- Win: Thorne nods approval (favor), loot 2 aether shards (25gp ea).

**Contingency:** PCs lose/flee? Wildlings scatter after 3 rnds (town guards mop up), PCs -1 rep w/ Wardens.

## Post-Fight Hook: Whispering Ingot (Puzzle/Intrigue)
"Honest" Omar slips through crowd: "Heroes! This hummed off a smuggler—solve it before Tithe. 50gp now, double payoff." (Ties backstories: Debt? Pays partial. Plague? Vial halts cryst.)

**Puzzle Beats (1hr, Gilded Anvil optional):**
1. **Runes (DC 13 Arcana):** Dwarvish: "Flesh yields to fire's kiss, but [?] endures." Whisper "aether" while heating (forge/campfire). Fail: 1d6 fire (Dex DC 12 half).
2. **Echo (Attune 1hr, DC 14 Insight group):** Tap heartbeat rhythm. Fail: Giggle echo (Vane tease), 2 Echo Shades (Shadow CR 1/2, metallic; 100 XP ea).
   Success: Vial (Plague halt 1d4 days) + map tease (vague grove).

**Twists:** Reborn acolyte claims it holy (Persuasion DC 14 standoff).
**Rewards:** 100gp salt + Ingot (Wondrous: Bonus Action +1d4 force weapon 1/short).

## Pacing/End (2-3hr Session)
- 20min event/chaos
- 30min combat
- 45min puzzle/explore 1 location (Omar/Market)
- Tease quests: Thorne offers "Hunt leavings" (vague Nyx).
**World Lives:** If delayed, Tithe/Reborn feud escalates—next day brawl.

**DM Notes:** Agency everywhere—ignore? World ticks (faction war rumor). Scale: Add Alpha if casters heavy.
