## Campaign Opener: Arrival at the Anchorspan (Narrator Voice – Deep, Echoing, Ominous)

_A voice like grinding stone and whispering wind fills your minds, ancient and apart, as if the Fracture itself speaks:_

**"Hear this, wanderers of the edge: This world is no cradle of balance. The Umberwilds breathe with feral chaos—shadows that swallow souls, surges that unravel flesh, giggles on the wind that lure the bold to ruin. Not all horrors scale to your strength; some will shatter parties like glass. Heed the signs: impossible glows, silences too deep, colors that bleed into madness. Discretion is valor's keenest edge. Sneak. Parley. Flee. Outwit the wild heart... and etch your legend into its stone."**

_The voice fades, leaving ozone on your tongues. Now, the world sharpens into focus._

You stand to the side of the rutted Salt Road, dust-caked boots sinking into the fine grit that coats everything like forgotten snow—pale blue flecks of skyfall salt glinting in the low sun. The fort rises beside you: a hulking two-story beast of weathered stone, its four squat towers thrusting upward like wary fists, banners of faded silver snapping in the updraft from the chasm. Armored figures pace the wall-walk, halberds glinting; from murder-holes above, eyes track every stranger. A massive iron-shod gate yawns open to your right, spilling the clamor of voices and the tang of sweat-oiled steel.

Behind you stretches the ragged pulse of Umbergate itself. To the north, along the road's curve inland, canvas-roofed wagons creak under loads of shimmering crystal sacks, drivers cursing muleteers amid the bray of beasts and hawkers' cries: _"Skyfall salt! A pinch wards rot for a year! Trade yer war scrap—best prices this side o' the Fracture!"_ Smoke curls lazy from cook-fires, carrying spit-roast meat and bitter herb-brews. Adobe hovels huddle in the leftward haze of the shantytown, their tent-flaps stirring with shadowed figures—refugees in threadbare cloaks, nursing crystal-veined limbs. Laughter erupts from a sunken pit-ring ahead, gravelly cheers and the wet thud of fists on flesh, bets shouted over a beast's guttural snarl. Farther right, in the wealthier sprawl, a rhythmic _clang-clang-clang_ rings out from behind a sturdy timber building—hammer on anvil, sparks flying like fireflies from an open forge-mouth, where a burly silhouette shapes glowing metal amid bellows' roar.

Just ahead, the road bends toward the lip. A low dry-stone wall bars the edge—five feet high, each fist-sized rock hand-laid with care, their greys and browns veined in faint Fracture-blue. Scratches mar every surface: names, dates, jagged pleas etched deep by knife or nail—"Elara, loved always," "Gone to the Maw, 3rd moon"—weathered by salt-wind into ghosts. A gaunt man in a grey linen robe kneels there, fingertips tracing faded letters, lips moving in silent prayer; nearby, a middle-aged woman with wind-tousled brown hair pauses, presses her palm to a fresh-carved stone, eyes glistening with quiet loss before she turns away, shawl clutched tight.

And then... the Fracture.

It gapes before you—a mile-deep wound in the world, sheer red-rock walls plunging into velvet shadow, bottomless and eternal. Updrafts scream upward, whipping cloaks and hair, laden with ozone's sharp bite, crystalline salt, and a feral undercurrent: wild magic's electric tang, laced with phantom blooms that bloom nowhere east—jasmine laced with copper and storm-petals.

Straddling it: the Anchorspan. Three hundred yards of ancient stonework, flat and impossibly long without middle support, defying the void like a god's defiant stride. No rails, no mercy—scoured barren by gales, yet uncracked after centuries, its surface etched with faded runes that pulse faintly at dusk. Only the brave, the foolish, or those seeking, dare it now; caravans shun the edge, rumbling safely on the inland side, but all keep a watchful eye to the fracture's side.

Beyond the Span... the Umberwilds.

**For two of you, it's a revelation—a riot of impossible wonder. Neon trees pulse like living flames, leaves in electric violets and searing crimsons; skies shimmer with auroral surges, veils of lime and cobalt dancing wild; twisted silhouettes flit through haze—beasts with too many wings, flowers that hum like harps. Your breath catches; the world east feels drab, colorless by comparison.**

**For the third... it's a reminder of home, but a more dimmed and distant version. Those same hues glow softer here, familiar as Feywild glades yet these Umberwilds are still pale to you— the vibrant heart you knew, muted by this scarred edge. To the east you see nothing but muted greys and browns now, stirring a pang of homesickness: whispers of wilder winds, lost kin amid eternal blooms.**

As you turn, waiting to check in at the fort as everyone does to begin their 30 days, whether its needed or not, you see (players)

As you wait for the guards, you hear a cry from the Gatehouse watch:

"A delver! Crossing the Span!"

A lone figure staggers into view halfway across: right arm fused with glittering crystal, veins spiderwebbing his flesh. He stumblesHe collapses, crawling the final yards before tumbling into the market dust, gasping:

"Nyx… he promised eternity…"

Shards explode outward in a razor spray. Chaos erupts.

## Player Agency Moment – Chaos Erupts (Roll Initiative – low stakes, 2–3 rounds max)

The Reborn’s body convulses again. Needle-sharp crystals spray in a 15-ft radius (1d4 piercing, Dex DC 13 save for half – non-lethal, just panic fuel).

You see and hear:

- Four burly collectors wearing **rust-red sashes and black iron torcs stamped with an ogre’s fist** (the colours of the Iron Tithe) shove forward.  
  “Tithe’s ten percent on everything – even corpses!” one snarls, already looting the dying man’s pack (4 × Tithe Thug CR 1/8).

- The grey-robed Vigil priest who had been praying at the Wall of Remembrance rushes forward, tears streaming.  
  “A martyr of the Maker! Touch not the sacred flesh!”  
  Two white-robed Reborn pilgrims trailing him drop to their knees beside him, hands raised in blessing. The priest (human male, late 50s, left hand replaced by gleaming aethersteel) begins a frantic, rising prayer.
  The grey-robed priest snaps at the white-robes without turning: “Enough of your metal gospel, Malach’s dogs – let the man die in peace!”

- From the Gatehouse balcony a tall, scarred woman in dark-blue Warden leathers – short iron-grey hair, sabre at her hip, voice like cracking ice – bellows:  
  “CLEAR THE MARKET! Wardens to arms! First idiot who draws steel without my word loses the hand!”  
  This is **Captain Renza Thorne**, commander of the Span Wardens.

- A wiry, sun-browned man with a crooked grin, too many rings, and a single gold tooth ducks behind a salt crate nearby, watching everything (**“Honest” Omar**, fence and information broker).

Immediate choices (mix & match):
1. Aid the dying Reborn (DC 13 Medicine) → dying whisper: “Dr. Nyx… deep in the glowing groves… he can make you eternal…”
2. Stop the four Iron Tithe thugs (combat or social)
3. Calm the Vigil priest & two pilgrims (Religion/Persuasion DC 13)
4. Protect nearby stalls / civilians
5. Do nothing – the town will remember who stood frozen

Wardens restore order in 3 rounds regardless.

## Wildlings Alarm
Gatehouse horn: three long, panicked blasts.  
“WILDLINGS ON THE SPAN! Six beasts – crossing the Anchorspan itself!”

**Combat** (scaled for 3 lvl-3 PCs, ~900 XP total):
- 1 [[Creatures/Wildling Alpha]]
- 5 [[Creatures/Wildling]]
- Terrain: market stalls (half cover), salt dust (Difficult Terrain), updrafts (flyers advantage)
- Victory: Captain Thorne nods approval + 2 aether shards (25 gp each)

## Post-Fight – Two Important Interruptions

### 1. “Honest” Omar approaches
The gold-toothed man saunters over, wiping neon wolf blood from his rings.

“Name’s Omar – they call me Honest, and that’s the joke.  
A smuggler pawned this off to me.  He never came back.”  
He produces a thumb-sized bar of aethersteel that hums with a faint metallic heartbeat.  
“Locked tighter than a dragon’s hoard, but whatever’s inside imight be worth a fortune.  
I’ll pay fifty gold right now for first rights. Solve its riddle, bring me the contents, and I’ll double it.  
Tithe’s already sniffing – clock’s ticking.”

**The Puzzle** (three quick beats you can run whenever they work on it)

1. Salt-crystal runes on the surface – DC 18 Arcana/Investigation to read “The Boy laughs last”.
2. Six floating tumblers inside – DC 19 Sleight of Hand/Thieves’ Tools to stop in the right order (giggling gets louder when close).
3. Final lock whispers a single word in the listener’s own childhood voice – they must repeat it aloud.

**Success – Read-aloud** The bar splits open with a soft child-giggle. Inside: a tiny vial of glittering aethersteel dust + the now-quiet ingot itself. Omar whistles, hands over another 50 gp in salt crystals (total 100 gp) and says, “Keep the humming toy. Just don’t blame me when it starts talking back.”

### 2. Captain Renza Thorne strides up (immediately after Omar steps back)
Captain Thorne plants her boots, hands on hips, eyes measuring the party.

“New faces. Handled yourselves well – most greenhorns would’ve frozen or run.  
What exactly did you see on that corpse before the crystals took him? Anything about where he came from?”  
(Insight DC 15 notices she’s fishing for Nyx rumours.)

She listens, nods once.

“You’re obviously fresh to the Gate. If you’re looking for work that pays, come find me up at the Gatehouse (she jerks a thumb toward the Keep).  
Got a missing three-person patrol that never reported back from the near Wilds. Could use eyes that don’t flinch.”

Softer tone: “First round tonight at the Broken Span Inn is on me. Tell Ma Jessa that Renza sent you – she’ll pour something that doesn’t taste like lamp oil.”

She claps the nearest PC on the shoulder and strides off.

# The Broken Span Inn – First Night in Umbergate

The last light dies behind the Fracture. Wind rattles the shutters like restless bones. You shoulder open the door of the Broken Span Inn and step into a fug of woodsmoke, sour ale, and sizzling fat.

A cracked sign shows the Anchorspan with one side snapped off and replaced by a foaming tankard. Blue-green aetherglass lanterns swing overhead, painting the room in shifting sea colours.

The common room is lively but not packed.

- A table of caravan guards argue over dice.
- A half-elf bard saws a jaunty tune on a battered lute.
- A stout dwarf with wire braiding in his beard Torvek Ironvein (the only person in Umbergate most folk have ever seen with an aethersteel arm) roars at a bad roll and slams his metal fist—THUNK—into the table, laughing like an avalanche.

In the far shadowed corner sits a brooding man—hood up, right palm resting on the table, yet you see a faint dull violet glow gently pulsing from his palm. you notice that Locals leave a three-seat halo of empty benches around him. 

Behind the bar stands **Ma Jessa Carver**—broad-shouldered woman in her fifties, throat a lattice of old burn scars that shine pale in the lantern light. Her own right palm bears the same faint dull violet glow 

Conversation quiets for a heartbeat when you enter—new faces always get measured—then surges back.

Ma Jessa’s gravelly voice cuts clean through the noise:

"newbies i see.  what can i get you lot, food, drink, place to crash?"

banter between party and Ma

She offers at an appropriate time -
“Mind the corner. That one’s come back from the Span three times. Came back quieter each trip. Hasn’t spoken since winter.”

Ma Jessa closes her eyes for a second, but her tone softens when she leans in so only the party hears:

“Torvek’s arm and my old scar are the only bits of aethersteel you’ll see on this side of the Fracture without selling your soul—or your firstborn. Everything else is tavern talk.”

She flashes a crooked, motherly smile that actually reaches her eyes.

“Rooms four silver, two if you share with the snorers. Stew’s edible tonight. Miracle.”

Then louder, across the room:

“Another Fracture Red for the quiet one in the corner— on the house, drink slow.”

The lone Marked raises his mug a finger’s breadth in silent thanks, sigil flickering once, then sinks back into shadow.

The bard strikes up a livelier reel. Dice clatter. Laughter rises.

Welcome to the Broken Span Inn.  
You’re home—for tonight, at least.
