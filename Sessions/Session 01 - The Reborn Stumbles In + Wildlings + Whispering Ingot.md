## Read-Aloud Opener (Arrival at Anchorspan)
[Your exact edited text – unchanged]

**Player Agency Moment – Chaos Erupts (Roll Initiative – low stakes, 2–3 rounds max)**

The Reborn’s body convulses once more. Razor-sharp crystals spray in a 15-ft radius (1d4 piercing, Dex DC 13 for half – non-lethal).

You see and hear:

- Four burly collectors in **Iron Tithe colors** – rust-red sashes and black iron torcs stamped with an ogre’s fist – shove forward.  
  “Tithe’s ten percent on everything, even corpses!” one barks, already rifling the dying man’s pack (4 × Tithe Thug CR 1/8).

- A lone Vigil priest in simple grey robes, who had been praying at the Wall of Remembrance, rushes forward crying,  
  “A martyr of the Maker! Touch not the sacred flesh!”  
  He drops to his knees, tears streaming. Two white-robed Reborn pilgrims trailing him fall beside their priest, hands raised in desperate blessing. The priest himself (human male, late 50s, aethersteel left hand gleaming) begins a rising, frantic prayer.

- From the Gatehouse balcony a tall, scarred woman in dark-blue Warden leathers – short-cropped iron-grey hair, sabre at her hip – bellows in a voice like cracking ice:  
  “CLEAR THE MARKET! Wardens to arms! First idiot who draws steel without my word loses the hand!”  
  **Captain Renza Thorne** surveys the chaos with hawk-sharp eyes.

- A wiry, sun-browned man with a crooked grin and too many rings ducks behind a salt crate nearby. Gold tooth flashing, he watches everything (**“Honest” Omar**, information broker and fence – no words yet).

Immediate choices (players can mix & match):

1. Aid the dying Reborn (DC 13 Medicine) → dying whisper: “Dr. Nyx… deep in the glowing groves… he can make you eternal…”
2. Stop the four Iron Tithe thugs (combat or social)
3. Calm the Vigil priest & two pilgrims (Religion/Persuasion DC 13)
4. Protect nearby stalls / civilians
5. Do nothing – the town will remember

Wardens restore order in 3 rounds regardless.

## Wildlings Alarm
[unchanged – horn, six beasts on the Span, combat as written]

## Post-Fight: Two Interruptions

### 1. “Honest” Omar approaches (after combat)
The wiry man with the gold tooth saunters over, wiping neon wolf blood off his rings.

“Name’s Omar – they call me Honest, and that’s the joke.  
Caught this off a smuggler who didn’t make it back yesterday.”  
He produces a thumb-sized ingot of aethersteel that hums like a trapped heartbeat.  
“Thing’s locked tighter than a miser’s purse, but I’m betting it’s worth a fortune.  
I’ll pay fifty gold right now for first rights. Solve its riddle and bring me whatever’s inside – I’ll double it.  
Tithe’s already sniffing; clock’s ticking.”

(He’ll wait nearby or at his stall in the Caravan Market until they’re ready.)

### 2. Captain Renza Thorne strides up (immediately after Omar steps back)
Captain Thorne plants her boots, hands on hips, sizing the party up with a soldier’s eye.

“New faces. Handled yourselves well – most greenhorns would’ve frozen or run.  
What exactly did you see on that corpse before the crystals took him? Anything about where he came from?”  
(Insight DC 15 to notice she’s fishing for Nyx rumours without saying the name.)

She listens, nods once.

“You’re obviously fresh to the Gate. If you’re looking for honest work – or at least work that pays – come find me up at the fort (she jerks a thumb at the Keep).  
Got a missing patrol that never reported back from the near Wilds. Could use eyes that don’t flinch.”

Softer tone: “First round tonight at the Broken Span Inn is on me. Tell Ma Jessa that Renza sent you – she’ll pour something that doesn’t taste like lamp oil.”

She claps the nearest PC on the shoulder and strides off.

## Whispering Ingot Side Quest – full hook now in Omar’s dialogue above
Puzzle, twists, and rewards unchanged – all in the file already.

## Pacing/End notes
- 20 min immersion + chaos  
- 30 min Wildlings fight  
- 20–30 min Thorne + Omar conversations  
- 30–60 min Ingot puzzle whenever they choose  
- Session ends with two clear threads: Thorne’s missing-patrol job and Omar’s ingot

**DM note on Thorne’s side quest (for you, not players yet):**  
“Hunt the Leavings” – a three-person Warden scout team vanished two days ago while mapping new beast trails 10 miles west of the Span. Tracks end at a grove of mirrored glass trees. Perfect level 3–4 investigation/combat delve, ties directly to early Nyx clues.

Copy, paste, commit.  
Session 01 is now airtight, sensory, and dripping with immediate consequences and hooks.  
Ready when you are for the missing-patrol one-page quest handout or anything else!
