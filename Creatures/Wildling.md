**Tags:** #monster/wilds #pack #neon-wolves Feral dire wolf-like beasts twisted by Wilds magic—size of large dogs, fur in vivid, shifting hues (electric lime, cobalt blue, acid orange) that pulse like auroras. Eyes like molten embers; saliva glows faintly, sizzling on stone. They surge with wild magic: on hit, 50% chance for random minor effect (hair stands on end, brief levitation, color spray burst).

**Read-Aloud (First Sighting):**

> From the Span-side haze erupt sleek shadows—five vivid wolves, fur blazing in impossible neon: limes that writhe like lightning, blues bleeding into the air. Jaws foam with glowing spit; eyes lock on you like hungry stars. They fan out, low and silent, magic crackling off their hides.
