**Tags:** #monster/wilds #alpha #neon-dire Massive dire wolf (horse-sized), neon pelt a riot of searing crimsons, violets, and golds—fur alive, tendrils lashing like whips. Mane flows like liquid plasma; roar warps air into surges (DC 13 Con or frightened). Commands pack; on crit, victim gains temporary wild surge (roll on table).

**Read-Aloud (Emerges):**

> The pack parts for _it_—a neon dire wolf, towering as a warhorse, hide a storm of crimson flames and violet voids, mane writhing like captive lightning. Its bellow shakes the Span, winds howling in sympathy; eyes promise unraveling.

**Combat Notes:** CR 2. Legendary actions: surge blast (10-ft cone, 2d6 force). Flees if below half HP.
