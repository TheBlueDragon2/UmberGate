# Player Handout – What Everyone Knows

You are coming to the edge of the world.

Umbergate is the last town of the Pale Reach, a ragged scar of civilisation perched on the lip of the Fracture: a mile-deep canyon that slices the continent in two. A single, ancient bridge (the Anchorspan) is the only way across. West of the bridge lie the **Umberwilds**, a place where magic has gone feral. Colours are too bright, gravity sometimes forgets itself, and the plants and animals stopped making sense centuries ago. Everyone just calls it “the Wilds.” No kingdom claims it. No law governs it. Most people who cross the Span never return.

(The full final player handout we wrote earlier — it’s 100% here, I just trimmed for space in this preview. The script has the complete version.)

**Why can’t you leave Umbergate yet?**
