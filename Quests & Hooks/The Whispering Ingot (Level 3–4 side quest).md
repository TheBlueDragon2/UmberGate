# The Whispering Ingot (Level 3–4 side quest)

**Given by:** “Honest” Omar in the aftermath of the Wildlings attack  
**Reward:** 200 gp in salt crystals + the Ingot itself  
**Hook:** Omar palms the humming ingot to the party — “Solve it before the Tithe claims it. 50 gp now, double when you crack it.”

**The Puzzle** (three quick beats you can run whenever they work on it)

1. Salt-crystal runes on the surface – DC 18 Arcana/Investigation to read “The Boy laughs last”.
2. Six floating tumblers inside – DC 19 Sleight of Hand/Thieves’ Tools to stop in the right order (giggling gets louder when close).
3. Final lock whispers a single word in the listener’s own childhood voice – they must repeat it aloud.

**Success – Read-aloud** The bar splits open with a soft child-giggle. Inside: a tiny vial of glittering aethersteel dust + the now-quiet ingot itself. Omar whistles, hands over another 50 gp in salt crystals (total 100 gp) and says, “Keep the humming toy. Just don’t blame me when it starts talking back.”
