# Hunt the Leavings – Captain Thorne’s Contract
**Level 3–4 | 1–2 sessions | Investigation + Horror | 3–4 PCs**

## Captain Thorne’s Brief
“Three days ago Sergeant Halric’s scout team went ten miles west to map new beast trails.  
Due back yesterday. Nothing.  
Last slate message: ‘Glass trees. Reflections wrong. Someone screaming inside the bark.’

Find them. Bring them back breathing if you can. Bring answers if you can’t.  
Pay: 300 gp + first pick of anything useful you recover.  
Extra 200 gp if you bring me proof of who—or what—took them.”

### Random Encounters (d4)
1. 2d4 Glass-Eyed Jackals (Wolf stats + immune to charmed/frightened)
2. Wild Magic Surge storm (each PC rolls on your short surge table)
3. Abandoned supply wagon – one dying merchant whispers “metal angels took the Wardens” and dies
4. No encounter

## The Mirrored Grove (arrival read-aloud)
A perfect circle of mirrored glass trees. Every surface reflects you… 2–3 seconds late, and sometimes smiling when you’re not.

DC 14 Investigation/Survival:
- Warden boot prints lead in, drag marks deeper
- Fresh blood on glass bark
- One tree scratched with a dagger: “NYX TRIES AGAIN”

## What Happened
Two Reborn acolytes ambushed the patrol last night and dragged them deeper for Dr. Nyx’s latest experiments.

## Key Locations
A. **Central Clearing**  
   2 Reborn Acolytes (CR 2 – Cult Fanatic stats; one has clanking aethersteel jaw) chanting over a portable altar.  
   They fight to the death rather than reveal anything about Nyx.

B. **Surgical Tree**  
   Sergeant Halric strapped spread-eagle, right arm amputated, crude leaking aethersteel graft bolted on (12 hp, delirious).  
   Free him: DC 15 Medicine or Strength.

C. **Cocoon Tree**  
   Tracker Vey half-consumed in liquid aethersteel up to the waist.  
   1-hour timer – free her (DC 16 Medicine/Strength) or she hardens into a screaming statue.

D. **Hollow Log**  
   Medic Solin hiding, dying (3 hp), clutching Halric’s journal.  
   If stabilised, he gasps:  
   “They wore white… spoke of the Maker… said Nyx would perfect us… deeper in the Wilds… deeper…”  
   Then dies or passes out.  
   Journal pages are frantic: sketches of failed grafts, the words “HE STILL CANNOT MAKE IT STICK” repeated, and a single arrow pointing roughly west-southwest with the note “more bodies needed.”

No distances, no landmarks, no camp location. Only dread and a direction.

## Rewards
- 300 gp + 200 gp bonus from Thorne
- Halric’s journal (proof something horrific is happening deeper in)
- Crude aethersteel arm (non-functional, worth 500 gp or future graft risk)
- Major reputation with Span Wardens if any scouts survive

## Contingencies
- Party late → Vey becomes permanent statue
- Acolytes escape → Nyx learns the party exists, not where they are
- Grove left intact → spreads 1 mile overnight
