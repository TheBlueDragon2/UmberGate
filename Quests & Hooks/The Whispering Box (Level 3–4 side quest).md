# The Whispering Box (Level 3–4 Side Quest)

**Given by:** “Honest” Omar (Caravan Market), right after the Wildlings attack chaos settles. He sidles up, eyes gleaming: “Saw you handle those beasts like pros. A smuggler pawned this off to me.  He never came back.” . I need this opened.  ill pay 50 gp now to crack it open quiet-like. Double if you hand me what's inside.” (He steathfully slips them a small, heavy wooden box, ~1 ft long x 8 in wide x 6 in deep.)

**Goal:** Open the box's main compartment via 3 escalating challenges. (Run beats whenever they tinker—bar, downtime, etc. Total ~15-20 min play.)

**Reward:** 100 gp total in skyfall salt crystals (50 upfront + 50 on delivery) + keep the box (now yours, with hidden value).

**Atmospherics:** Box is plain but expertly joined oak (no hinges visible, seamless lid). Feels unnaturally warm; faint giggling echoes from within when shaken (Vane's playful voice, but players won't know yet). Salt dust clings to runes like fresh snow.

## Step 0: Assess the Box (Optional Skill Check)

**DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation):** Reveals masterful craftsmanship—no tool marks, pressure-fitted panels suggest multiple inner layers. "This wasn't made by any local carpenter; it's layered like a noble's puzzle safe. Expect tricks."

_Success:_ Grant Inspiration for the first puzzle beat (players feel clever). _Failure:_ "Sturdy work, but nothing special." (No penalty.)

## Puzzle Beats (3 Steps – Clear Progress Indicators)

Run in sequence. Each success: _Soft click from within; lid shifts 1/4 inch looser; giggling grows louder, more childlike/manic._ Failures: Box warms uncomfortably (+1 fire dmg if forced, resets progress).

1. **Runes on the Lid****DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation):** Fine salt-crystal glyphs etched into the wood glow faintly. Deciphering reveals: “The Boy laughs last.” _Success Read-Aloud:_ “The crystals flare violet—then crumble to dust. _Click._ The lid twitches. A muffled giggle bubbles up, closer now.” _Hint (if stuck >2 rounds):_ Blowing/sweeping salt away (no check) partially works (half DC).
2. **Inner Tumblers****DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand or Thieves' Tools):** Lid cracks enough to peer in—six thumb-sized crystal tumblers float in arcane grooves, spinning lazily. Align them in "giggle order" (trial/error: louder hum = correct sequence, revealed by rune: try 3-1-6-4-2-5). _Success Read-Aloud:_ “They snap into place with a resonant _chime_. _Click._ The lid lifts halfway—warm air whooshes out, carrying peals of delighted laughter.” _Hint:_ Tools give advantage; humming peaks on correct tumbler.
3. **The Whisper****DC 15 Wisdom (Insight):** Box fully ajar now—final rune pulses. It whispers **one word** in the listener's _own childhood voice_ (personalize: "Mama," pet name, lullaby snippet—improv based on backstory if known). Must repeat aloud to listener (anyone). _Success Read-Aloud:_ “Your voice echoes back from the box—then dissolves in a final, triumphant giggle. _Click._ The lid springs open fully.” _Failure:_ Whisper repeats mockingly; retry after 1 min (nerves shaken, disadv next time). _Hint:_ Arcana notes it's a "voice-key" (echoes user's tone).

## Success: Main Compartment Opens

**Read-Aloud:**

> The lid pops free with a sigh. Nestled in velvet is a thumb-sized shard of aethersteel—pale, shimmering, humming faintly to itself.

Omar (when delivered): “Hah! That's the good stuff—worth ten times what I paid. Here's your 50 more in salt. Solid work; might have bigger jobs if you keep deliverin'.” _He pockets shard, turns to leave—pauses._ “Eh, keep the box. Souvenir.”

## Hidden Secret (DM Only – Post-Delivery)

**DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) or Detect Magic:** Faint lead-lined false bottom (blocks initial divinations). Pry with thieves' tools (DC 15 Dex) or knock open.

**Inside:**

- **Automapper Parchment** (Wondrous Item, Uncommon: Blank vellum sheet (~letter size). When viewed, ethereal ink blooms—**auto-draws a map of your exact current location** (updates in real-time as you move/explore; fog-of-war style—reveals rooms, terrain, hidden doors if searched). Fades if folded away; re-activates on unfold. (Recharge: Dawn. Wilds surges may glitch it colorfully.) _Read-Aloud:_ “The page stirs like living mist. Lines etch themselves: the Caravan Market, your exact spot... even the alley shadows shift as you turn.”
- **Wilds Compass** (Wondrous Item, Uncommon): Palm-sized brass, needle spins normally at first (true north). _Secret:_ In Wilds (post-Span), needle twitches toward nearest surge/anomaly (or Vane's whims).

**Plot Tie-In:** Map/compass are Vane "toys" (giggle origin). Hints at deeper game—e.g., compass later points to Nyx camp or Maw. Players discover lead-lining blocked scrying (Omar missed it entirely).

## Contingencies & Scaling

- **Too Easy (Lvl 4+):** Add DC +2; tumblers deal 2d4 force on jam.
- **Too Hard:** Group checks (help action); Omar drops hint for extra 10gp.
- **Player Agency:** Destroying box (DC 22 Str/Arcana) yields shard + shattered map (one-use).
- **Escalation:** If they dawdle, Tithe goons "inspect" box (combat hook).
