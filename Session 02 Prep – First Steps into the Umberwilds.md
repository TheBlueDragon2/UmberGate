# Session 02 Prep – First Steps into the Umberwilds  
**Tags:** #session-prep #umberwilds #thornes-quest #nyx-hook  

## Goal  
Give the players their first real taste of the Wilds: wonder, danger, and unmistakable proof that “bad trees and bad sounds” means Dr. Nyx is close. Keep it short, vivid, and 100% choice-driven.

## Starting Point  
The party is 30–40 minutes west of the Anchorspan, slightly lost (low Survival rolls). They’re pushing through dense neon foliage toward where the scouts were meant to map beast trails.

## Read-Aloud Opener  
The canopy knits shut overhead like living stained glass—leaves in electric violet and searing crimson pulsing with slow heartbeats. The air turns thick and sweet, laced with ozone and overripe fruit. Your footsteps sometimes sink too deep, sometimes bounce as if the ground forgets its own weight. Birdsong has stopped. Instead, a low, wet scraping drifts on the wind… like fingernails dragging across wood.

## The Twisted Grove (First Encounter Area)  

### Atmosphere  
- Trunks veined with throbbing crimson light.  
- Long strips of bark peeled back and twitching like flayed skin.  
- Ground carpeted in soft violet moss that glows faintly underfoot.  
- Distant whispers inside the wood—syllables almost forming words.

### Discovery (Passive Perception 13 or active search)  
A small clearing holds three shredded Span Warden tents. Blood trails vanish into the trees. One halberd is buried blade-first in a trunk that has already begun growing around the steel. The whispering grows louder here, coming from the bark itself.

### The Threat – 4 Barkblights  
**Description (first sighting)**  
Four humanoid shapes uncoil from the trunks—bodies of twisted bark and strangling vine, needle-sharp thorns bristling. Amber knot-eyes glow with feral hunger. Branches drag across the moss with deliberate slowness.

**Stats**  
Use Needle Blight (MM p.32) or Tree Blight if you want bigger threat. Reskin:  
- When struck hard, they spurt glowing crimson sap (extra 1d6 acid on melee hits).  
- On death, they collapse into harmless piles of twitching bark.

### Key Clues (found during/after combat or by careful search)  
1. **Cocooned Scout** – One warden still breathing, pinned high in living vines. Early Glass Plague crystals glitter on arms and neck. Delirious mutters: “The Maker… promised perfection… metal that never breaks… no more pain…”  
2. **Blood Map** – On torn tent canvas: crude arrow pointing deeper west labeled “perfect bodies” beside a scratched symbol—a hand with fingers replaced by aethersteel.  
3. **Aethersteel Finger** – Detached, self-repairing digit clutched in a dead warden’s fist. Surgical cut, not battle damage.

### Player Choices & Contingencies  
- **Fight** – Straightforward but messy; blights try to grapple and drag PCs into trees (Strength save DC 13 or restrained).  
- **Sneak/Avoid** – Group Stealth DC 15; blights are territorial and won’t pursue far.  
- **Investigate Sounds** – Nature/Arcana DC 15: trees corrupted by wild magic bleed—early sign of Nyx’s experiments nearby.  
- **Rescue the Scout** – Medicine DC 13 to stabilize; success gives clearer Nyx intel, failure means he dies begging for “the Maker’s mercy.”

### Pacing Notes  
- Whole scene should take 45–75 minutes.  
- If they flee or sneak, they still spot the blood map from afar.  
- End with clear next step: follow the arrow deeper (toward Nyx’s fringe camp) or return to Umbergate with proof.

### Rewards  
- 300 gp from Thorne for answers (plus 200 gp if they identify Nyx as cause).  
- The aethersteel finger (minor magic item: self-repairs tools, +1 to one tool check/day).  
- XP as normal + milestone feel for surviving first Wilds taste.

### Alive World Tick  
While they’re out, note:  
- Reborn Path sermon scheduled tonight in town.  
- New war refugees arriving—rumors of Iron Dominion push closer.

Drop this straight into Obsidian. Run it loose—they’ll surprise you, and that’s perfect. You’ve got this!
