# Session 02 Prep – First Steps into the Umberwilds  
**Tags:** #session-prep #umberwilds #thornes-quest #nyx-hook  

## Goal  
Give the players their first real taste of the Wilds: wonder, danger, and unmistakable proof that “bad trees and bad sounds” means Dr. Nyx is close. Keep it short, vivid, and 100% choice-driven.

## Starting Point  
The party is 30–40 minutes west of the Anchorspan, slightly lost (low Survival rolls). They’re pushing through dense neon foliage toward where the scouts were meant to map beast trails.

## Read-Aloud Opener  
The canopy knits shut overhead like living stained glass—leaves in electric violet and searing crimson pulsing with slow heartbeats. The air turns thick and sweet, laced with ozone and overripe fruit. Your footsteps sometimes sink too deep, sometimes bounce as if the ground forgets its own weight. Birdsong has stopped. Instead, a low, wet scraping drifts on the wind… like fingernails dragging across wood.

## The Path (First Encounter Area)  
# Session 02 – Encounter 1: Luminous Path Ambush  
**Tags:** #session-prep #umberwilds #thornes-quest #encounter-1  

## Goal  
Breathe life into the Wilds' beauty-before-danger rhythm. Start serene, hit with insect swarms (easy chaos), escalate to spider hunter. Plants scout clues naturally. 30-45 min, high agency.

## Read-Aloud Opener (Entering the Path)  
A narrow stone path winds ahead, ancient slabs cracked and overgrown with luminous moss pulsing soft emerald and azure. Tall grasses and wildflowers glow—violets, pinks, blues blooming in perpetual twilight. Tiny blue orbs drift like fireflies, casting misty beams. Twisted vine sculptures rise silently. Night-blooming jasmine scents the air; footsteps release shimmering spores.

**Passive Perception 13+**: Faint blood flecks on path edge—scouts passed recently.

## The Ambush  

### Round 1: Insect Swarms (3 Swarms)  
**Description (first buzz)**  
The floating orbs wink out. A high-pitched whine swells—clouds of thumb-sized insects erupt from flowers, iridescent wings flashing neon. Needle proboscises gleam; they dive in frenzied hunger.

**Stats**  
- Use Swarm of Insects (MM p.338), reskin: Wilds Stirges.  
- Bonus: Blood-drain leaves faint crystal flecks (early Glass Plague hint).  
- **On hit**: "Victim's skin sparkles briefly with unnatural crystals."

### Round 2+: Giant Spider Hunter 
**Description (drop-in)**  
A shadow detaches from vines—massive spider (house-cat size) skitters down silk threads, fangs dripping venom. It's hunting the swarms, but eyes lock on you mid-leap.

**Stats**  
- Giant Spider 
- Bonus: Web strands pulse with wild magic—restrained targets take 1d4 force on escape.

## Key Clues (Search DC 13 or post-fight)  
1. **Scout Gear**: Span Warden insignia cloak  


## Rewards  
- Spider fangs (2d6 piercing darts, 3 uses).  

## The Twisted Grove (Second Encounter Area)  

### Atmosphere  
- Trunks veined with throbbing crimson light.  
- Long strips of bark peeled back and twitching like flayed skin.  
- Ground carpeted in soft violet moss that glows faintly underfoot.  
- Distant whispers inside the wood—syllables almost forming words.

### Discovery (Passive Perception 13 or active search)  
A small clearing holds three shredded Span Warden tents. Blood trails vanish into the trees. One halberd is buried blade-first in a trunk that has already begun growing around the steel. The whispering grows louder here, coming from the bark itself.

### The Threat – 4 Barkblights  
**Description (first sighting)**  
Four humanoid shapes uncoil from the trunks—bodies of twisted bark and strangling vine, needle-sharp thorns bristling. Amber knot-eyes glow with feral hunger. Branches drag across the moss with deliberate slowness.

**Stats**  
Use Needle Blight (MM p.32) or Tree Blight if you want bigger threat. Reskin:  
- When struck hard, they spurt glowing crimson sap (extra 1d6 acid on melee hits).  
- On death, they collapse into harmless piles of twitching bark.

### Key Clues (found during/after combat or by careful search)  
1. **Cocooned Scout** – One warden still breathing, pinned high in living vines. Early Glass Plague crystals glitter on arms and neck. Delirious mutters: “The Maker… promised perfection… metal that never breaks… no more pain…”  
2. Logbook -  log is in common and shows that the wardens have been tracked and monitored for the last two weeks.  Journal page (Nyx hook: "He replaces the weak parts.").  
3. Humanoid tracks are also around

### Player Choices & Contingencies  
- **Fight** – Straightforward but messy; blights try to grapple and drag PCs into trees (Strength save DC 13 or restrained).  
- **Sneak/Avoid** – Group Stealth DC 15; blights are territorial and won’t pursue far.  
- **Investigate Sounds** – Nature/Arcana DC 15: trees corrupted by wild magic bleed—early sign of Nyx’s experiments nearby.  
- **Rescue the Scout** – Medicine DC 13 to stabilize; success gives clearer Nyx intel, failure means he dies begging for “the Maker’s mercy.”

### Pacing Notes  
- Whole scene should take 45–75 minutes.  


### Rewards  
- 300 gp from Thorne for answers (plus 200 gp if they identify Nyx as cause).  

### Alive World Tick  
While they’re out, note:  
- Reborn Path sermon scheduled tonight in town.  
- New war refugees arriving—rumors of Iron Dominion push closer.
