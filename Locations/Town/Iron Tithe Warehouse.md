# Iron Tithe Warehouse

**Tags:** #location/town #iron-tithe #storage

Massive stone-and-iron storehouse at the edge of the Dustveil. The Iron Tithe’s cut of everything that moves through Umbergate.

## Description (read-aloud)
> Iron doors wide enough for wagons. Inside: mountains of skyfall salt sacks, crates of weapons, and the ogre “Taxman” Korr counting coins with sausage fingers.

## Key NPC
[[NPCs/Town/“Taxman” Korr]]

## Mechanics
- 10% tax on all declared goods entering or leaving town
- Failure to pay = confiscated goods + public flogging

## Rumors (d6)
1. “Korr’s got early-stage Glass Plague — that’s why he wants the powdered aethersteel so bad.”
2. “The warehouse basement connects to old salt mines that run under the Fracture.”

## Secrets (DM only)
> [!secret]
> - Korr is hoarding enough aethersteel dust to halt the Plague for a decade.
> - A hidden tunnel leads directly to Silent Cal’s smuggling docks.
