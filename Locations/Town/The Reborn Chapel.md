Converted warehouse near the Dustveil. Walls painted with murals of flesh becoming perfect metal.

## Description (read-aloud)
> Candlelight flickers off polished aethersteel icons. The air smells of incense and machine oil. Worshippers kneel, some with gleaming replacement limbs proudly displayed.

## Key NPC
[[NPCs/Town/Brother Malach Vale]]

## Services
- “Blessing” ceremonies (replace a limb with aethersteel — 100 gp + donor steel)

## Rumors (d6)
1. “Malach’s right arm is pure aethersteel — and it still bleeds.”
2. “They say the Maker speaks through him now.”
