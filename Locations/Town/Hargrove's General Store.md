# Hargrove's General Store

**Tags:** #location/town #trade #general-store #caravan-quarter

Respectable outfitter on Wall Road (between Caravan Market and Dustveil). Clean shelves, fair prices, no haggle — a rare honest shop in a den of dealers. Owned by the "Hargrove Brothers," a towering figure in a weathered trench coat who moves with uncanny precision.

## Description (read-aloud)
> The sign swings with a faint *clink* of hidden chains: "Hargrove's — Supplies for the Span, Salt, and Beyond." Inside, the air smells of oiled leather, fresh canvas, and a peculiar musky tang like wet scales. Shelves are stocked low and neat (oddly accessible for "dwarves"), with tiny claw-scratches along the edges and piles of shiny copper nuggets "for luck." A massive trench-coated figure looms behind the counter — broad-shouldered, hat pulled low — its coat bulging oddly at the seams, accompanied by muffled tail-thumps and synchronized burps from three depths. "Welcome, travelers! What'll it be?" booms a polished voice from the top.

4. "They'll trade aethersteel dust under the counter — discreetly."
