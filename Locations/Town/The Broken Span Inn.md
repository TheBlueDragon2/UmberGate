# The Broken Span Inn

**Tags:** #location/town #hub #social

The beating heart of Umbergate’s night life. Rough-hewn, salt-crusted tavern 50 yards inside the Anchorspan gatehouse.

## Description (read-aloud)
> You push through the battered oak door and the wind’s howl drops to a growl. Inside: low beams, green-violet hearth, air thick with pipeweed, ale, and ozone. Floor crunches with salt and sawdust. In the shadowed corner booth sits one of the Marked — palm on the table, sigil pulsing slow violet like a dying star.  
> Behind the bar stands **“Ma” Jessa Carver**, broad as the Span itself, throat a rope of old scars. Voice like gravel:  
> “New blood? Sit. Drink. Give the Marked space — that place’ll mess with you.”
