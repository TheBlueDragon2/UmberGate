# The Keep

**Tags:** #location/town #span-wardens #military

Two-storey fortress with four squat towers straddling the eastern end of the Anchorspan. Home and HQ of the Span Wardens.

## Description (read-aloud)
> The Keep looms like a stone lion, banners of the Pale Reach snapping in the updraft. Murder holes glare down; ballistae track the Wilds horizon. Wardens in salt-stained scale patrol the wall walk, eyes hard. From the highest tower you can see clear across the Fracture and deep into the riotous color of the Wilds.

## Key NPCs
- [[NPCs/Town/Captain Renza Thorne]]
- Lt. Garrick Holt (second-in-command, by-the-book human)

## Features
- Barracks, armory, war room, cells (rarely used — 30-day law)
- Top tower: signal fire & massive warning horn
- Ground floor: public audience chamber (Thorne holds court every dawn)

## Rumors (d6)
1. “Captain Thorne lost her left eye to a Wildling that spoke with Vane’s voice.”  
2. “The cells beneath the Keep are lined with aethersteel — nothing escapes.”  
3. “Wardens get first pick of any aethersteel brought back — that’s the real tithe.”

## Secrets (DM only)
> [!secret]
> - Thorne keeps a private war map: Iron Dominion forces are only one season away.
> - Hidden vault holds 3 ingots of aethersteel — emergency fund to hire mercenaries if the Reach falls.
