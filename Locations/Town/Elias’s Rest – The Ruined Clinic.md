# Elias’s Rest – The Ruined Clinic
**Location:** Dustveil shantytown, three crooked alleys behind the Laughing Maw fight pit  
**Tags:** #location/town #ruins #nyx #investigation

### Read-aloud when the players first see it (day or night)
A single-storey shack of weathered plank and corrugated tin, half-collapsed inward.  
The sign still swings on one hinge: “Elias’s Rest – All Welcome.”  
Someone carved beneath it in fresh, angry cuts:  
“My knowledge of medicine has reached its limits. I must find new knowledge.”

The door hangs open. Salt-dust drifts across the threshold like snow.

### Exterior details (players poking around)
- Front doorframe: the famous quote is carved deep; dried blood in the grooves.
- Rear wall: a crude escape hatch (DC 15 Investigation to spot) leads to a narrow crawlspace that exits into an abandoned goat pen 40 ft away (Nyx’s actual escape route).
- Roof: partially caved in; moonlight/street-torch light spills onto the operating floor.

### Interior – one large room (30 × 40 ft)
Atmosphere: copper-sweet blood, antiseptic, and ozone.  
Temperature 10 ° colder than outside (the ichor still reacts).

#### Key features & clues
1. **Four operating tables** (wooden, blood-soaked, restraining straps chewed or cut)  
   - Table 1 (nearest door): woman’s half-finished torso (DC 13 Medicine reveals she was alive when the chest was opened).  
   - Table 3: child-sized body, both arms replaced with aethersteel that still flexes slowly (1 hp construct, harmless, just creepy).

2. **Walls – anatomical charts**  
   - Precise, beautiful ink diagrams titled “Stages of Ascension – Toward the Deathless Form.”  
   - Final panel shows a human silhouette 100 % aethersteel with the caption:  
     “When every cell is vessel, death becomes impossible.”

3. **Workbench along the north wall**  
   - 2 empty crystal vials (formerly held ichor)  
   - 1 half-full vial of powdered aethersteel (50 gp value, 5 doses – each dose halts Glass Plague progression for 1 month if ingested)  
   - Surgical tools (masterwork, 25 gp) still flecked with quicksilver  
   - Open journal (last readable entry, 3½ months ago):

> Day 107 of the second wave.  
> Mercy and Jonas walk without pain. Stillborn’s heart beats 32 times per minute and has not varied in six days.  
> The others reject because their souls cling to rotten flesh.  
> I was wrong to ask permission.  
> Perfection cannot be refused, only delayed.  
> Tomorrow we leave before they burn what they do not understand.

4. **Hidden floor cache** (DC 18 Investigation or knock reveals loose plank)  
   - Small locked iron box (Nyx’s key long gone, DC 20 to pick or break)  
   - Inside:  
     • 1 intact vial of Vane’s ichor (glows softly, worth a fortune or a death sentence)  
     • Hand-written letter addressed to Sister Amara Sol, never sent:

> Amara,  
> If they come for me, tell the children I did not abandon them.  
> Tell Malach the work continues.  
> When I return with the Deathless Form, they will beg for the gift I offered freely.  
> — E.

5. **Secret (DM eyes only)**  
   - Every midnight, the child-sized aethersteel arms on Table 3 reach toward anyone in the room bearing a Maw palm-mark and spell slots (as if trying to complete a circuit). If touched, the arms whisper in Nyx’s calm voice:  
     “Bring me more steel. Bring me more flesh. Bring me home.”

### Possible encounters if players linger after dark
- 1d4 Reborn Path zealots (commoners or acolytes) come to “protect the holy site.”  
- 1 Glass Plague scavenger (ghoul stats, missing lower jaw) drawn by residual ichor.  
- Captain Thorne herself shows up with two Wardens if the players make noise—she’ll share what she saw the night of the mob, voice shaking.
