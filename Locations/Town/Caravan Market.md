Sprawling open-air bazaar in the Caravan Quarter. Canvas awnings flap like sails; the air is a riot of spices, salt, sweat, and lies.

## Description (read-aloud)
> Bells, shouts, the bray of pack-beasts. Stalls overflow with skyfall salt, Wilds curios, war surplus, and things that definitely aren’t legal east of the Fracture. In the center stands a garish crimson pavilion — “Honest” Omar’s domain.
