# The Gilded Anvil

**Tags:** #location/town #crafting #aethersteel

Master smithy in the Gilded Crest (rich district, right of Wall Road). The only forge in town that can reliably work aethersteel without the metal “biting back.”

## Description (read-aloud)
> Heat rolls out like a living thing as you step into the Gilded Anvil. Twin forges roar green-white; hammers the size of ogres fall in perfect rhythm. Racks of weapons gleam: salt-forged picks, Span-guard halberds, and — locked behind runed glass — a single aethersteel longsword that drinks the light.  
> At the main anvil stands **Torvek Ironvein**, dwarf master-smith, his right arm a seamless prosthesis of living aethersteel that flexes like muscle. He doesn’t look up. “If ye’ve coin or steel worth working, speak. Otherwise, mind the sparks.”

## Proprietor
[[NPCs/Town/Master Smith Torvek Ironvein]]

## Rumors (d6)
1. “Torvek’s arm isn’t from the Maw — it’s Nyx’s prototype.”  
2. “He forges for the Wardens by day, smugglers by night.”  
3. “Touch the aethersteel blade on display and you’ll dream of the High Arcanist’s laughter.”  
4. “Torvek keeps a locked drawer of failed ‘living’ weapons that still twitch.”

## Secrets (DM only)
> [!secret]
> - Back-room vault contains three incomplete aethersteel golem limbs (Nyx experiments he bought to study).
> - Trades rare ingots with Factor Lysa Vell of the Fractal Consortium for forbidden alloys.
> - His arm occasionally whispers in Vane’s giggling voice when raw aethersteel is nearby.
