# Vigil Hospice

**Tags:** #location/town #healing #vigil-of-lorris

Clean, white-washed stone building in the Caravan Quarter. Smells of antiseptic herbs and candle wax. Run by the Vigil of Lorris (goddess of mercy and dawn).

## Description (read-aloud)
> Cool, quiet air washes over you as you enter the Vigil Hospice. Rows of neat cots, soft golden light from ever-burning braziers, and the faint hum of protective wards. Patients — salt miners with shattered limbs, Glass Plague victims in final stages, war deserters hiding wounds — lie in varying states of hope and despair.  
> At the center stands **Sister Amara Sol**, half-elf cleric, her holy symbol a rising sun worked in aethersteel wire. Her smile is gentle, but her eyes miss nothing.

## Key NPC

## Services (all free, donations encouraged)
- Healing (diseases, wounds, Glass Plague stabilization)  
- Last rites & burial in the Wall of Remembrance  
- Sanctuary for anyone truly penitent (even after 30 days)

## Rumors (d6)
1. “Sister Amara can slow the Glass Plague with a touch — but never cure it.”  
2. “She keeps a locked ward for patients who start turning to metal overnight.”  
3. “The Vigil is stockpiling aethersteel dust — preparing for war or something worse.”

## Secrets (DM only)
> [!secret]
> - Hidden basement ward: three full-body Nyx constructs kept alive in stasis (research, not cruelty).
> - Amara has a single vial of Vane’s distilled essence — will use it only if the town itself is dying.
