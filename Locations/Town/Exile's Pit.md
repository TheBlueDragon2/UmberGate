# Exile's Pit

**Tags:** #location/town #fight-pit #rumor

Sunken stone arena behind the Caravan Quarter. Roars and cheers echo across the dusty streets. Blood, sweat, salt dust, and the faint tang of ozone from the Wilds fill the air. Packed nightly from dusk, drawing desperate challengers, war deserters, salt miners, and anyone with nothing left to lose.

## Immersive Description (read-aloud on entry)
> You descend rough-hewn steps into Exile's Pit, the crowd's roar crashing over you like a Wilds surge. Torches sputter along pitted stone walls scarred with old knife marks. The oval pit (60 ft x 40 ft, 10 ft deep) is ringed by rickety bleachers crammed with howling faces—scarred veterans, salt-grimed miners clutching bets, and a few wild-eyed pilgrims.  
> The sand floor crunches underfoot, stained dark with old blood. Chains rattle from iron cages along the far wall, holding snarling Wilds beasts: iridescent cats with too many eyes, floating jelly horrors, twig-limbed ambushers.  
> A booming voice cuts through: **"Next blood! Who dares?"** Victory here means coin, respect, and a chance to be forgotten for one more night.

## Features

- **Bar:** Ma Jessa supplies (via runners); cheap rotgut.
- **Pit Bosses:** Rotating council of tough veterans (no named leader).

## Rumors (d6)
1. “Win three in a row and the pit bosses will remember your name.” ⟨common⟩
2. “Losers sometimes vanish into the Wilds — never seen again.” ⟨whispered⟩
3. “The sand is stained with more than blood.” ⟨false⟩

## Secrets (DM only)
> [!secret]
> - Pit bosses occasionally sell hopeless losers to someone in the Wilds.
> - One regular beast is a polymorphed former champion (Dispel reveals).
> - Hidden trapdoor under sand: leads to a forgotten salt vein (mini-delve).

**DM Tips:** Perfect for downtime, earning coin, building reputation, or tying into backstories (deserter fights for redemption, etc.). Escalate: a PC win streak draws personal attention from the bosses.
