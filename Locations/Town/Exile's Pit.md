# Exile's Pit

**Tags:** #location/town #fight-pit #marked #rumor

Sunken stone arena behind the Caravan Quarter. Roars and cheers echo out into the street. Blood, sweat, salt dust, and the tang of ozone from Wilds beasts fill the air. Packed nightly from dusk, drawing survivors, desperate challengers, war deserters, and thrill-seekers.

## Immersive Description (read-aloud on entry)
> You descend rough-hewn steps into Exile's Pit, the crowd's roar crashing over you like a Wilds surge. Torches sputter violet flames along pitted stone walls etched with glowing palm-sigils. The oval pit (60 ft x 40 ft, 10 ft deep) is ringed by rickety bleachers crammed with howling faces— salt-grimed miners clutching bets, Reborn zealots chanting metal hymns.  
> Sand floor crunches underfoot, stained dark with old blood and scattered steel flecks. Chains rattle from iron cages lining the far wall, holding snarling Wilds beasts: iridescent cats with too many eyes, floating jelly horrors, twig-limbed ambushers.  
> A booming voice cuts through: **"Next blood for the Pit Who dares?"** The air thrums—victory here means coin, respect, and there are whispers that others watch remotely

## Rumors (d6 – Add #rumor tag for Dataview)
1. “Win three in a row and the fracture itself will call your name"
2. “Losers sometimes get dragged across the Span — never seen again.” ⟨whispered⟩
3. “The pit floor is paved with aethersteel shards.” ⟨false⟩

## Secrets (DM only)
> [!secret]
> - Council sells worst losers to Nyx as “raw material” (Survival DC 15 on losers).
> - One regular beast is a polymorphed former 3-win champion (Dispel reveals).
> - Hidden trapdoor under sand: aethersteel vein tease (leads to mini-delve).

**DM Tips:** Use for downtime, rep-building, backstory ties (e.g., deserter fights for redemption). Escalate: PC streak → personal challenge from council. Always end with hook (favor/rumor/Nyx clue).
